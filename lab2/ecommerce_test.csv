Household,"The Overlocker Technique Manual: The Complete Guide to Serging and Decorative Stitching Review Aug 2014 This is the third of the books that Search Press sent to me for review purposes. I chose to review it because although more and more home sewists are investing in overlockers (or `sergers'), it seems to me that they are often perceived as `scary' machines - so I thought this book might appeal! I bought my overlocker in 2011 and it probably wasn't until last year that I actually nailed how to rethread the thing quickly. To be perfectly honest, it wasn't the threading that was an issue: although a bit fiddly, I can do that bit in a couple of minutes. No, it was getting the tension of all the threads right that took hours. It became like a jackpot - sometimes I would rethread and it would be fine straight away, and other times I would fiddle about for hours. One day last year, out of pure frustration, whilst feeding my test scraps of fabric through and trying to get the right tension, I manually pulled each of the four threads in turn as they were feeding through, making the tension incredibly tight for a short time and then letting go and letting it feed through normally. For some unknown reason, it worked a treat, and this is what I do each time now if it isn't working properly. So, it took me two years to be able to confidently rethread my machine. I knew my machine had uses other than finishing raw edges and sewing knits, but until a few weeks ago when I sat down in front of the overlocker with this book at hand, I hadn't experimented at all. Why? I suppose time was a factor. Who wants to spend hours on end faffing around with an overlocker? I could make a dress in that time! But this book review was the incentive I needed to get down to business - how could I review a book properly without putting it to the test? Readers - I gave this book a thorough test. I worked my way through this book in maybe 5 or 6 hours, starting right at the beginning and working through in order. As I began to work through the book, my main question for the purposes of this review was: how is this book different to my instruction manual? After all, there is no value in buying a book that is the same as the overlocker's manual (unless, of course, you don't have the manual for your machine). The book is divided into three chapters: `Overlocking Basics', `Techniques' and `Quick Constructions'. Working in conjunction with this book and my overlocker instruction manual, I familiarised myself with what each bit of the overlocker is called and what it is/can be used for. Some of this I already knew, but I did learn some new things and as a result of the exercise I now have quite a thorough understanding of the machine. In the three years of owning my overlocker, only once have I changed the differential feed - I did this to help gather up the hem of a circle skirt. The book taught me that when the differential feed is a higher number than `N' (normal), the front teeth of the feed dog move more quickly than the back teeth, and this creates gathering. When the differential feed is lower than `N', the front teeth move more slowly than the back teeth, to create a stretch effect (depending upon the fabric type, of course). One thing that I had always found confusing in my overlocker manual was something it referred to as `size of bight', and elsewhere in the manual `width of bite'. This `bight'/'bite': I had no idea what it was - only that I could widen it if I wanted. But the book taught me that it's the cutting width - perhaps this `bight'/'bite' is a translation error in my manual or something? Either way, I'm glad to have finally got that information straight! Under the guidance of this book, I learnt how to retract the upper knife, how to adjust the stitch width, and how to remove the stitch finger. This enabled me to stitch a teeny tiny rolled hem! I'm so pleased I learnt how to do this, I can definitely see me using this function a lot. I also learnt how to make pin-tucks on the overlocker, French seams, welt seams and fell seams. I would never have considered using my overlocker before for any of these seam finishes. It isn't exactly rocket science, but it was good to learn some alternative methods. The book tells you how to use a variety of different attachments, such as elastic and beading attachments and piping, blind-hemming, gathering, bias binding, taping and cording feet. My machine only has one foot, but this foot doubles up as a cording foot due to the small hole in the top of the foot through which one can feed cord. With the help of the book I learnt how to overlock over a piece of cord or yarn (for decorative purposes), and how to overlock over stabilising tape, which will be useful when constructing seams of knit garments that need extra stabilisation, such as shoulder seams and waist seams. I didn't have any clear elastic to practise with, but I imagine that would work on the same principle as the seam tape. So far so good. The techniques section of this book really did enable me to get to grips with my machine. I learnt new techniques that I will definitely use again, and these techniques were explained in a much clearer way than in my manual, and with clear photographs too. The `Quick Constructions' section is comprised of a series of simple projects in which you can test out your newly acquired overlocking skills. The projects are basic, and nothing to write home about. The chapter does finish with a `Guide to Fabrics' section though - giving guidance on different fabrics and what size needles they would be best paired with, what differential feed to use, what stitch length is best, suggested tension settings and tips on hemming techniques. These four pages are very, very useful. The biggest disappointment of this book was that there was no mention of the care and maintenance of your overlocker - for instance how (and where) to oil it, how to remove the needle plate and clean the feed dogs, how to change the bulb, the blades etc. After all the time I spent learning about how to use the machine, I felt so invested in it that I was willing to spend another hour giving it a mini home-service, but the book doesn't touch on this at all, which I think is a great shame. I may have learnt a lot about the functionality of the machine, but I'm still a bit nervous about taking it to pieces to clean it properly! Boo! One other, small, gripe: it suggests overlocking with different types of thread to achieve different effects, for example using thread that changes colour, metallic thread, woolly nylon, embroidery thread, even yarn...which is all very well and good if these are wound onto a bobbin, but when I attempted to use some metallic pearl cotton from a skein, I was left wondering how on earth to wind it suitably and place it securely onto the bobbin holder?? Overall, this is a good book to have. I've learnt a lot from it and, although it is not tailored specifically to my exact model of machine, it has been a lot more useful than the manual itself has ever been. I would recommend the book to people who have overlockers with no manual, or to people who want to get more from their machines and try new techniques. * threadcarefully.com * Feb 14 Want a professional finish to your sewing?

Household,"Trust Basket Carnation Mixed Flowers Seeds (Green) About seeds: Planting seed is an inexpensive way to grow your favorite plants. Growing plants from seed has many good benefits. We will save money, we can choose from varieties far beyond those locally available, we also experience the joy of watching a lifeless seed sprout into a living plant. A seed is a plant embryo, its initial food supply is stored within a protective coating. Seeds remain dormant until a combination of moisture, temperature, air, and light triggers germination. In order to plant the seeds, the potting mixture or soil should be moisten or slightly wet. Plant the seed half or an inch inside the soil. When seeds are first planted, they need an extra bit of water in order to start the germination process. Water the seeds regularly via sprinkler, seeds rely on a constant supply of water to go through the germination process, thereby producing a sprout. Water on a regular basis so that the potting mixture is always moist but never soaking. When your seeds outgrow their containers and are planted outside, they will not need nearly as much water to thrive. It may take few days to few weeks for the seeds begin to push tiny sprouts through the soil. At this point, they should be moved to natural sunlight. Place them where it gets plenty of light throughout the day. It may take several weeks before your plants are ready to be transplanted. Most plants go through a growth phase which makes it easy to know when they are ready to be moved outdoors. The first set of leaves that appear are known as the seed leaves. The second set of leaves to appear are called the true leaves and are a sign that your plants are matured and ready for moving. You can feed the plants with a bit of liquid fertilizer after they have sprouted, to help expedite this growing process."

Books,"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari Review Everyone loves a good fable, and this is certainly one. The protagonist is Julian Mantle, a high-profile attorney with a whacked-out schedule and a shameful set of spiritual priorities. Of course it takes a crisis (heart attack) to give Mantle pause. And pause he does--suddenly selling all his beloved possessions to trek India in pursuit of a meaningful existence. The Himalayan gurus along the way give simple advice, such as, ""What lies behind you and what lies before you is nothing compared to what lies within you."" Yet it is easy to forgive the story's simplicity because each kernel of wisdom is framed to address the persistent angst of Western white-collar professionals. Here is the story of Julian Mantle, a superstar lawyer whose out-of-balance lifestyle leads him to a near-fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom. His physical collapse brings him into a spiritual crisis that forces him to confront the condition of his life. Hoping to find happiness and fulfillment, he embarks upon an extraordinary odyssey to an ancient culture, where he discovers a powerful system to release the potential of his mind, body, and soul and learns to live with passion, purpose, and peace. Brilliantly blending ancient spiritual wisdom of the east with contemporary success principles of the West, this inspiring tale provides a step-by-step approach to living with greater courage, balance, abundance and joy. From the Back Cover Product Dimensions: 8.4 x 5.4 x 0.4 inches The # 1 International Bestseller Wisdom to Create a Life of Passion, Purpose, and Peace This inspiring tale provides a step-by-step approach to living with greater courage, balance, abundance, and joy. A wonderfully crafted fable, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari tells the extraordinary story of Julian Mantle, a lawyer forced to confront the spiritual crisis of his out-of-balance life. On a life-changing odyssey to an ancient culture, he discovers powerful, wise, and practical lessons that teach us to: Develop joyful thoughts Follow our life s mission and calling Cultivate self-discipline and act courageously Value time as our most important commodity Nourish our relationships, and live fully, one day at a time 				    	 					              See all Product description"

Rhonda has written three more bestselling books: The Power in 2010, The Magic in 2012, and Hero in 2013. 				    	 					 From AudioFile Audio seems like the natural medium for Rhonda Byrne's blockbuster motivational book on positive thought for positive results. The Australian TV producer leads listeners through her exposition on the secret of life. Quoting from an array of New Age gurus and interpreting more traditional teachers as well, the program integrates sound bites from the various authors, with actors taking many of the roles. Neale Donald Walsh, Denis Waitley, Jack Canfield, and dozens of others make cameo comments throughout the program. Byrne's slightly whispery, intimate voice calling the listener to believe alternates with hyped ""you-can-do-it"" encouragement from speakers like Bob Proctor. Kudos goes to the production team that integrated the dozens of speakers--some just introducing who will speak next. The resulting audio keeps a rapid pace hop-skipping along to support Byrne's premise of the essential ""Law of Attraction.""

Books,"The Evolution Of Gods : The Scientific Origin Of Divinity And Religion Review I liked this book very much. Since my childhood, I was much skeptical and confused about gods and their roles in our life. Whether some divine power created and nourished humans or this dogma was a human projection. I always asked if one God made us then why He created poor & rich, beautiful & ugly and so on. This book taught me that all gods are imaginary and made by us for our convenience. The author has provided several interesting evidence to support his main argument that humans created gods. He has discussed prehistoric religion to depict how humanity would have invented gods. He has mentioned a brief history of religions to explain how we built religions. This book has one amazing chapter to discuss the problems created by religions for modern humans. The book has a lot of great and altogether new ideas. --Radha Krishna Jan 11, 2013I rarely write a review, even then I am writing, since I absolutely loved this book. I am surprised to read the contents, which are altogether new. This book has compiled several religious practices prevalent during the prehistoric and historic time. After reading those, a clear cut picture appears how and why humans would have created or imagined their gods. Humans imagined and worshipped the divine powers or gods in order to explain their mysteries and miseries. The author has established that religions caused and nourished the most common human miseries like women exploitation, poverty, slavery, Tantar-Mantra and several diseases. I have been a devotee, but certainly have problems with several aspects of religions. This wonderful book has explained almost all my previous questions and specially the impact of the concept of gods on humans today. This book has shattered my faith. It is a painful experience to know that all religious dogmas and gods are an illusion. Now, I do not have an imaginary savior to protect me. Yes, if my savior was my imagination or illusion then this book have done a great job to open my eyes.

We heard about evolution of organisms and mankind before but this time Gods have been proved to be evolved. Such kind of books should be included in school text-books so that the young minds can set themselves free. The author never becomes judgmental at any point. He just provide details with solid & concrete evidences. --Manjil Mukherjee Sep 13, 2012 				    	 					 Book Description The Evolution of Gods: The Scientific Origin of Divinity and Religions Did gods create mankind, or did mankind create gods? Why, when and how did mankind begin to worship gods? Religious scriptures the world over claim that one or the other god made all plants and animals, but science has not yet identified any supernatural power that created and governed living beings. Was it man who came up with the idea of gods to help him cope with his own fears? Could it be that ancient people attributed natural phenomena-unfathomable and frightening to them-to the working of invisible gods? What kind of sufferings or fears made people bow before unseen powers or gods as we call them? When were these gods created? Who invented morals and methods of worship? Who wrote the ancient scriptures such as the Bible and the Vedas? Most crucially, have gods and the scriptures shaped our responses to the world around us? The Evolution of Gods seeks to answer these questions, and explains scientifically how, when and why religions and gods came into being. Ajay Kansal marshals anthropological and historical facts about the development of religions in a simple and straight forward manner to assert that it was mankind that created gods, and not the other way around.

Books,"The Evolution Of Gods : The Scientific Origin Of Divinity And Religion Review I liked this book very much. Since my childhood, I was much skeptical and confused about gods and their roles in our life. Whether some divine power created and nourished humans or this dogma was a human projection. I always asked if one God made us then why He created poor & rich, beautiful & ugly and so on. This book taught me that all gods are imaginary and made by us for our convenience. The author has provided several interesting evidence to support his main argument that humans created gods. He has discussed prehistoric religion to depict how humanity would have invented gods. He has mentioned a brief history of religions to explain how we built religions. This book has one amazing chapter to discuss the problems created by religions for modern humans. The book has a lot of great and altogether new ideas. --Radha Krishna Jan 11, 2013I rarely write a review, even then I am writing, since I absolutely loved this book. I am surprised to read the contents, which are altogether new. This book has compiled several religious practices prevalent during the prehistoric and historic time. After reading those, a clear cut picture appears how and why humans would have created or imagined their gods. Humans imagined and worshipped the divine powers or gods in order to explain their mysteries and miseries. The author has established that religions caused and nourished the most common human miseries like women exploitation, poverty, slavery, Tantar-Mantra and several diseases. I have been a devotee, but certainly have problems with several aspects of religions. This wonderful book has explained almost all my previous questions and specially the impact of the concept of gods on humans today. This book has shattered my faith. It is a painful experience to know that all religious dogmas and gods are an illusion. Now, I do not have an imaginary savior to protect me.

Books,"The Gallery It is said sometimes that female figure is the most beautiful thing God created. Naturally it is a fascinating subject for all painters. John Fernandes with his extraordinary talent paints figures with ease and confidence. Now-a-days in the art field when a cyclonic storm of 'creativity' and 'freedom of expression' is going on, John stands like a rock, proclaiming that 'Drawing' in itself is an art and drawing and painting a figure is one of the most challenging subject for an artist. John is a draftsman of tremendous ability. His confidence and the power of execution make one feel that God stuck a brush in his hand instead of a sword. He draws and paints so naturally that it looks as if he is just enjoying it - especially when he paints a female figure, bringing all the grace and delicacy of the model. Surely he is an artist who can be called a phenomenon."

Books,Ballet and Modern Dance Third Edition: Revised And Updated By James Rutter (World of Art) Review Will be of benefit to all dance lovers. — Backstage 				    	 					 About the Author Susan Au is a freelance writer and dance historian. She is a contributor to The International Encyclopedia of Dance and was the American consultant for The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet.
Books,"A Time to Dance Review * “In Venkatraman’s delectably scented, sensual world, lyrically told through verse and through Veda, life is illuminated as a beautiful celebration of doing what comes naturally, as best as one is able. Veda's awakening of her gift throughout her altered body and revolutionary prosthesis provides a spiritually uplifting premise. . . . . The acclaimed author of Climbing the Stairs, Venkatraman deftly shapes readers’ comprehension of physical ability into a new arc of understanding. To even have a passing thought that Veda is disabled, rather than differently-abled, would be utter madness. Set against a cardamom, melted butter, and semolina sojji-wafted landscape, the novel’s emotional expression and accompanying music impel the reader to share Veda’s belief that ‘Shiva dances everywhere. In everyone. In everything.’” — Booklist, STARRED REVIEW* “Weaves together several themes so elegantly that they become one: Veda’s bodily exertion, learning to dance with her prosthetic leg; her process of changing her dance technique to be emotional and spiritual as well as physical; and all the rest of Veda’s life, including young love, grief, insecurity and a dawning awareness of class issues. . . . Fluid first-person verse. . . . Veda’s no disabled saint; awkwardness and jealousy receive spot-on portrayals. . . .A beautiful integration of art, religion, compassion and connection.” — Kirkus Reviews, STARRED REVIEW* “The descriptions of contemporary India are beautiful and Venkatraman weaves images so divine that you can see the statues of Shiva, hear the ankle bells in the bharatanatyam dance, and smell the acrid scent of burnt rubber from the accident. Told in verse, this story is magnificently strong as Veda’s determination dances off the page and into the reader’s heart.” — VOYA, STARRED REVIEW* “This exceptional novel, told entirely in verse, captures beautifully the emotions of a girl forced to deal with a number of challenges and how she overcomes them on her way to becoming a confident young woman. It is sure to appeal to readers who are also trying to find their place in the world.” — School Library Journal, STARRED REVIEW* “Deftly wrought free-verse. . . . The language is lilting and rhythmic . . . the sensory elements evocatively describe the sights and sounds of Veda’s rich Indian surroundings. Her existential ponderings . . . are woven seamlessly into the tale, and her moments of jealousy and rage are presented honestly. Heart-achingly hopeful and beautifully written, this story will remain with readers long after the final line of verse.” — The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, STARRED REVIEW“Brief lines, powerful images, and motifs of sound communicate Veda’s difficult struggle to accept her changed body—and her new limitations, especially in dance. . . . Subplots exploring other loves and losses also help Veda learn about herself, her faith, and her art. And, eventually, after a successful return to dance, Veda again feels whole.” — The Horn Book  About the Author Padma Venkatraman (www.padmasbooks.com) is an oceanographer by training and a writer by choice.

Books,"Dance Dance Dance From Booklist There are only a handful of writers in the world who have the ability to thrill like Murakami. Skipping lightly, he has managed to dodge the triple curse of late-twentieth century literary fashion. No political realism, no magic realism, and no postmodernist retooling here. Leaping straight out of the slightly slow-witted but earthy and vigorous head of genre fiction, he has landed on the other side of our age, bypassing altogether the school of elegant repetition and self-conscious significance so admired by the publishing houses of London, New York, and Paris. Employing the flat tone of American writers like Dashiell Hammet and Raymond Carver and peppering his narratives with allusions to the plastic and materialistic world around him, Murakami yet manages to spin fantastic and surprisingly spiritual yarns as odd and riveting--though a good deal more uplifting--as the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch. As in almost all his other works, the protagonist of Dance is an ordinary guy, a reluctant but curious participant in events revolving around the intersection of our world with one very unlike it. The real hero of the tale is a sheepman living in a different dimension within the heart of a modern hotel, a sort of shaman the narrator met before in Wild Sheep Chase (1989), the novel which first established Murakami's reputation in this country. Along with these characters is a clairvoyant teenage girl, a one-armed beach-combing poet, two or three extremely erotic prostitutes, a lonely and slightly sinister filmstar, and a nervous desk clerk. How these odd characters fit into Murakami's wild and hilarious idea of a plot is impossible to describe, but once picked up, Dance is hard to put down. Unfortunately, while the twists in Murakami's imagination carry the reader along, the novel wilts in one or two places, which may disappoint some readers after the never-takes-a-breath action of the finer Hardboilded Wonderland and the End of the World (1991). Still, this is a wholly endearing tale, very sexy, very adult, and in its own way very tender. Murakami is truly a novelist like no other.

One April day, the impulse to write a novel came to him suddenly while watching a baseball game. That first novel, Hear the Wind Sing, won a new writers’ award and was published the following year. More followed, including A Wild Sheep Chase and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, but it was Norwegian Wood, published in 1987, which turned Murakami from a writer into a phenomenon. His books became bestsellers, were translated into many languages, including English, and the door was thrown wide open to Murakami’s unique and addictive fictional universe.Murakami writes with admirable discipline, producing ten pages a day, after which he runs ten kilometres (he began long-distance running in 1982 and has participated in numerous marathons and races), works on translations, and then reads, listens to records and cooks. His passions colour his non-fiction output, from What I Talk About When I Talk About Running to Absolutely On Music, and they also seep into his novels and short stories, providing quotidian moments in his otherwise freewheeling flights of imaginative inquiry. In works such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84 and Men Without Women, his distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday, of melancholy and humour, continues to enchant readers, ensuring Murakami’s place as one of the world’s most acclaimed and well-loved writers."

Routine: read book. Reward: fully comprehend the art of manipulation.”—Bloomberg Businessweek“A fresh examination of how routine behaviors take hold and whether they are susceptible to change . . . The stories that Duhigg has knitted together are all fascinating in their own right, but take on an added dimension when wedded to his examination of habits.”— Associated Press “There’s been a lot of research over the past several years about how our habits shape us, and this work is beautifully described in the new book The Power of Habit.”—David Brooks, The New York Times “A first-rate book—based on an impressive mass of research, written in a lively style and providing just the right balance of intellectual seriousness with practical advice on how to break our bad habits.”—The Economist “I have been spinning like a top since reading The Power of Habit, New York Times journalist Charles Duhigg’s fascinating best-seller about how people, businesses and organizations develop the positive routines that make them productive—and happy.”—The Washington Post “An absolutely fascinating . . . book [that explores] a startling and sometimes dismaying collision between the increasingly sophisticated scientific understanding of habits—how they’re formed, how they can be disrupted and changed—and, among other things, companies’ efforts to use that knowledge to steer your habits and money their way.”—Wired “If Duhigg is right about the nature of habits, which I think he is, then trying to get rid of these bad habits won’t work.

Books,"21 Lessons for the 21st Century Review “The human mind wants to worry. This is not necessarily a bad thing—after all, if a bear is stalking you, worrying about it may well save your life. Although most of us don’t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days, modern life does present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism, climate change, the rise of A.I., encroachments on our privacy, even the apparent decline of international cooperation. In his fascinating new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the historian Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers, Sapiens and Homo Deus, covered the past and future respectively, his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our anxieties, he suggests, is not to stop worrying. It’s to know which things to worry about, and how much to worry about them. . . . Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. . . . [Harari] has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the twenty-first century.”—Bill Gates, The New York Times Book Review“If there were such a thing as a required instruction manual for politicians and thought leaders, Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century would deserve serious consideration. In this collection of provocative essays, Harari, author of the critically praised Sapiens and Homo Deus, tackles a daunting array of issues, endeavoring to answer a persistent question: ‘What is happening in the world today, and what is the deep meaning of these events?’ . . . Harari makes a passionate argument for reshaping our educational systems and replacing our current emphasis on quickly outdated substantive knowledge with the ‘four Cs’—critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity. . . . Thoughtful readers will find 21 Lessons for the 21st Century to be a mind-expanding experience.”—BookPage (top pick) “A sobering and tough-minded perspective on bewildering new vistas.”—Booklist (starred review)  “Magnificently combining historical, scientific, political, and philosophical perspectives, Harari . . . explores twenty-one of what he considers to be today’s ‘greatest challenges.’ Despite the title’s reference to ‘lessons,’ his tone is not prescriptive but exploratory, seeking to provoke debate without offering definitive solutions. . . . Within this broad construct, Harari discusses many pressing issues, including problems associated with liberal democracy, nationalism, immigration, and religion. This well-informed and searching book is one to be savored and widely discussed.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “A highly instructive exploration of ‘current affairs and . . . the immediate future of human societies.’ Having produced an international bestseller about human origins and avoided the sophomore jinx writing about our destiny, Harari proves that he has not lost his touch, casting a brilliantly insightful eye on today’s myriad crises, from Trump to terrorism, Brexit to big data. . . .

From AudioFile Audio seems like the natural medium for Rhonda Byrne's blockbuster motivational book on positive thought for positive results. The Australian TV producer leads listeners through her exposition on the secret of life. Quoting from an array of New Age gurus and interpreting more traditional teachers as well, the program integrates sound bites from the various authors, with actors taking many of the roles. Neale Donald Walsh, Denis Waitley, Jack Canfield, and dozens of others make cameo comments throughout the program. Byrne's slightly whispery, intimate voice calling the listener to believe alternates with hyped ""you-can-do-it"" encouragement from speakers like Bob Proctor. Kudos goes to the production team that integrated the dozens of speakers--some just introducing who will speak next. The resulting audio keeps a rapid pace hop-skipping along to support Byrne's premise of the essential ""Law of Attraction.""

Books,"21 Lessons for the 21st Century Review “The human mind wants to worry. This is not necessarily a bad thing—after all, if a bear is stalking you, worrying about it may well save your life. Although most of us don’t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days, modern life does present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism, climate change, the rise of A.I., encroachments on our privacy, even the apparent decline of international cooperation. In his fascinating new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the historian Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers, Sapiens and Homo Deus, covered the past and future respectively, his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our anxieties, he suggests, is not to stop worrying. It’s to know which things to worry about, and how much to worry about them. . . . Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. . . . [Harari] has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the twenty-first century.”—Bill Gates, The New York Times Book Review“If there were such a thing as a required instruction manual for politicians and thought leaders, Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century would deserve serious consideration. In this collection of provocative essays, Harari, author of the critically praised Sapiens and Homo Deus, tackles a daunting array of issues, endeavoring to answer a persistent question: ‘What is happening in the world today, and what is the deep meaning of these events?’ . . . Harari makes a passionate argument for reshaping our educational systems and replacing our current emphasis on quickly outdated substantive knowledge with the ‘four Cs’—critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity. . . . Thoughtful readers will find 21 Lessons for the 21st Century to be a mind-expanding experience.”—BookPage (top pick) “A sobering and tough-minded perspective on bewildering new vistas.”—Booklist (starred review)  “Magnificently combining historical, scientific, political, and philosophical perspectives, Harari . . . explores twenty-one of what he considers to be today’s ‘greatest challenges.’ Despite the title’s reference to ‘lessons,’ his tone is not prescriptive but exploratory, seeking to provoke debate without offering definitive solutions. . . . Within this broad construct, Harari discusses many pressing issues, including problems associated with liberal democracy, nationalism, immigration, and religion. This well-informed and searching book is one to be savored and widely discussed.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “A highly instructive exploration of ‘current affairs and . . . the immediate future of human societies.’ Having produced an international bestseller about human origins and avoided the sophomore jinx writing about our destiny, Harari proves that he has not lost his touch, casting a brilliantly insightful eye on today’s myriad crises, from Trump to terrorism, Brexit to big data. . . . [In] twenty-one painfully astute essays, he delivers his take on where our increasingly ‘post-truth’ world is headed. Human ingenuity, which enables us to control the outside world, may soon re-engineer our insides, extend life, and guide our thoughts. Science-fiction movies get the future wrong, if only because they have happy endings. Most readers will find Harari’s narrative deliciously reasonable, including his explanation of the stories (not actually true but rational) of those who elect dictators, populists, and nationalists. His remedies for wildly disruptive technology (biotech, infotech) and its consequences (climate change, mass unemployment) ring true, provided nations act with more good sense than they have shown throughout history.

The protagonist is Julian Mantle, a high-profile attorney with a whacked-out schedule and a shameful set of spiritual priorities. Of course it takes a crisis (heart attack) to give Mantle pause. And pause he does--suddenly selling all his beloved possessions to trek India in pursuit of a meaningful existence. The Himalayan gurus along the way give simple advice, such as, ""What lies behind you and what lies before you is nothing compared to what lies within you."" Yet it is easy to forgive the story's simplicity because each kernel of wisdom is framed to address the persistent angst of Western white-collar professionals. Here is the story of Julian Mantle, a superstar lawyer whose out-of-balance lifestyle leads him to a near-fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom. His physical collapse brings him into a spiritual crisis that forces him to confront the condition of his life. Hoping to find happiness and fulfillment, he embarks upon an extraordinary odyssey to an ancient culture, where he discovers a powerful system to release the potential of his mind, body, and soul and learns to live with passion, purpose, and peace.

Books,"The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment From AudioFile The author shares ideas about personal integration with uncommon eloquence and a deep understanding of the human condition. Our true identity is in our moment-to-moment experiences rather than in our past or future. Concern about anything but the present is an unhealthy identification with the mind that can only cause pain and an illusion of control. Being totally aware of ourselves in each moment actually requires little effort or direction if we stop our thoughts long enough to find the pure consciousness that exists in the gaps between them. These ideas will be radical for most Westerners, but they are so smoothly elucidated that almost all seekers of inner truth will find something of value in the program.

Books,"Model Connections: How to Recruit Nude Models, Direct Photo Shoots, and Build Working Relationships About the Author A K Nicholas is an art photographer from the United States who specializes in figurative imagery. A diverse background and traditional art education prompted him to develop a unorthodox aesthetic that blends sensual imagery with a painterly style of manipulated colors. He was introduced to art through museum visits and other cultural experiences in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia. Growing up the Middle East, he saw how women's bodies were hidden from public view. In stark contrast, Europeans mostly lacked prudishness. Compare those to the US, where we have a bifurcated culture: half of us celebrate our beauty while the other half shuns it. He did not become interested in art until high school; taking a surrealism art history class, he realized he could explore art that interested him and began learning painting. His initial training with the nude was figure drawing while studying art in college. His first nude shoot was a complete surprise to him when a classmate in college assumed that his invitation to model meant for her to be nude. Although trained in drawing and painting, photography became his concentration by the conclusion of his art degree. Following art school, he put in his dues clerking and staffing the darkroom of a camera store. In the decades following his first shoot, he has photographed hundreds of nude models for pictorial books, limited edition prints, and his instructional books. In recent years he has dedicated himself full time to being an artist. He collaborates with models to create alternate realities, on what he calls ""a journey with no known destination."" With his passion for sharing knowledge, he writes to help you learn from his experience, including how to avoid some common mistakes and to encourage your creativity"

Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. INTRODUCTIONWhen I first launched my dream to be a professional photographer back in the early 1970s, I began as most did at that time: by shooting with the less expensive black-and-white films. I had my own darkroom, which meant that I was also processing all of my own black-and-white film and making prints of the best shots. Six months after I exposed my first black-and-white photograph, I walked into the local camera store in Salem, Oregon, and was delighted to find seven rolls of outdated film sitting in a half-price basket on the countertop. I quickly grabbed all seven rolls, paid the salesperson around fourteen dollars, and headed out the door, gleeful at the money I had saved and in anticipation of a camping trip that weekend, when I would surely shoot all seven rolls.After my return on Monday, I was visiting my brother—the one who inspired me to get into photography in the first place—and shared the fun I'd had shooting all seven rolls. I laid them out on his kitchen counter, asking whether I needed to take any extra steps to process the outdated film. He looked at them and quickly said, “You can’t process any of these rolls because they’re not black and white. This is color slide film!” I was stunned. As far as I was concerned, a slideshow was the last thing I wanted to make. I was sure the compositions from the camping trip had been my best work yet, but now they would never be the amazing black-and-white images I had hoped to print. Seeing my crestfallen face, my brother pointed out that it was possible to have prints made from color slides—it was just expensive and time-consuming. The wait could be up to one week and I, at the young age of eighteen, had yet to master the art of patience.Days passed before my frustration subsided enough to return to the camera store with the seven rolls of Agfachrome 50 film. And several days later, I returned to pick up my slides after a long day’s work as a maintenance man for the City of Salem. What happened next was truly a defining moment in my then-young photographic career. As I placed each slide across the camera store’s light table, I was confronted with some truly remarkable color-filled compositions. The fields of wildflowers and the blue sky with white puffy clouds seemed to leap off the light table. A plate of sliced cucumbers and tomatoes (one of my meals on the camping trip) screamed with the vividness of complementary colors. It was transformative; I was awash in the tremendous power of color. Within minutes, I asked the camera-store owner if he had any more outdated film—if he did, I would take every last roll.Unfortunately, he had no more, but he did offer an attractive discount if I would buy ten rolls at once, and an even better one if I would buy twenty (called a “brick” of film). Little did I know just how many bricks I would buy over the next thirty-plus years. My love for color photography had begun.Soon after, I picked up an orange filter at the camera store and started using it to photograph sunsets and sunrises. And later, while fumbling through a cardboard box on the countertop of that same camera store, I discovered a deeply colored magenta filter and a deep blue filter. Although I never found much use for the blue filter, I had no trouble beginning my love affair with the magenta filter. It was remarkably useful when shooting during the predawn and twilight “blue hour,” when the sun is below the horizon and the sky takes on a predominantly blue hue, as well as for shooting cityscapes and landscapes."

Books,"Oxford Handbook of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation (Oxford Medical Handbooks) Review Being a member of the superb Oxford Handbook series, I automatically assume this book will be very good and put very simply, it is very good and certainly lives up to its heritage. Dont be put off by the title handbook; this is a chunky but portable book that is full of useful information about the numerous tests we order on a daily as well as infrequent basis. The net result is a book that many of us would want to own and a book in the right hands is likely to be used often. (Dr Harry Brown, Glycosmedia)From the Foreword: ""Its size, scope and relevance mean that it is likely to be used daily as a quick reference and aide-memoire...No medical student or junior doctor should be without this book (it's ideal for revision), in fact any doctor at any stage of their career will find it useful."" (Suzy Lishman, President of The Royal College of Pathologists, 2018) 				    	 					 About the Author Dr Provan is currently Honorary Reader in Autoimmune Haematology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. He studied molecular genetics at Leicester University before studying medicine. After junior medical posts in the UK, I undertook research at The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 1993-4 on an American Traveling fellowship awarded by the Medical Research Council. As a general haematologist, his main area of interest within the field of haematology is immunohaematology which includes diseases such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP), neutropenia and haemolytic anaemia. He has written several medical books including Molecular Haematology (Blackwell Science), Oxford Handbook of Clinical Haematology and Oxford Handbook of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation, and the ABC of Clinical Haematology (BMJ books)."

Books,Handbook Medical Laboratory Technology: 2nd edition 
Books,"Oxford Handbook of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation (Oxford Handbooks) Review ... the 'black bible' has been a very useful find. Written by active clinicians, this is a very practical book, extremely useful for a quick reference on the wards and one of the few pieces of medical literature that concentrates on investigations and how to interpret them. Northwing (Sheffield Medical School Gazette) This book not only tells you which investigations to order in numerous clinical situations but how to interpret the results, which is all-important. It is written by clinicians, is wonderfully pragmatic and the last word on clinical investigation ... Strongly recommended. Dr Harry Brown The editors deserve credit for bringing together such a comprehensive oversight of currently available tests. Although this little handbook is likely to be of most benefit to the junior doctor on the 'shop floor', it could be a valuable source of knowledge to more senior doctors, medical students and anyone who has a role in ordering or carrying out investigative procedures.

Books,LETTERS TO MILENA (Works) 
Books,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower Review What is most notable about this funny, touching, memorable first novel from Stephen Chbosky is the resounding accuracy with which the author captures the voice of a boy teetering on the brink of adulthood. Charlie is a freshman. And while's he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. He's a wallflower--shy and introspective, and intelligent beyond his years, if not very savvy in the social arts. We learn about Charlie through the letters he writes to someone of undisclosed name, age, and gender, a stylistic technique that adds to the heart-wrenching earnestness saturating this teen's story. Charlie encounters the same struggles that many kids face in high school--how to make friends, the intensity of a crush, family tensions, a first relationship, exploring sexuality, experimenting with drugs--but he must also deal with his best friend's recent suicide. Charlie's letters take on the intimate feel of a journal as he shares his day-to-day thoughts and feelings: I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why. With the help of a teacher who recognizes his wisdom and intuition, and his two friends, seniors Samantha and Patrick, Charlie mostly manages to avoid the depression he feels creeping up like kudzu. When it all becomes too much, after a shocking realization about his beloved late Aunt Helen, Charlie retreats from reality for awhile. But he makes it back in due time, ready to face his sophomore year and all that it may bring. Charlie, sincerely searching for that feeling of ""being infinite,"" is a kindred spirit to the generation that's been slapped with the label X. --Brangien Davis -- About the Author About the Author: Stephen Chbosky was born on January 25, 1970. He is an American novelist, screen writer and film director. Chbosky was born and raised in Pittsburgh. He graduated from the University of South California in screenwriting program."

Wanderlust explores these fun aspects of travel while offering a completely Indian perspective on life outside India.  Sandhhya Iyer, thirty-seven and single, is going through the motions of living, never expecting and not getting much from life.

Books,"How To Win Friends And Influence People Amazon.com Review This grandfather of all people-skills books was first published in 1937. It was an overnight hit, eventually selling 15 million copies. How to Win Friends and Influence People is just as useful today as it was when it was first published, because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to ""the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people."" He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person's point of view and ""arousing in the other person an eager want."" You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, ""let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers,"" and ""talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person."" Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. --Joan Price  About the Author Dale Carnegie (1888-1955) described himself as a ""simple country boy"" from Missouri but was also a pioneer of the self-improvement genre. Since the 1936 publication of his first book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, he has touched millions of readers and his classic works continue to impact lives to this day.

Books,"21 Lessons for the 21st Century Review “The human mind wants to worry. This is not necessarily a bad thing—after all, if a bear is stalking you, worrying about it may well save your life. Although most of us don’t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days, modern life does present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism, climate change, the rise of A.I., encroachments on our privacy, even the apparent decline of international cooperation. In his fascinating new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the historian Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers, Sapiens and Homo Deus, covered the past and future respectively, his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our anxieties, he suggests, is not to stop worrying. It’s to know which things to worry about, and how much to worry about them. . . . Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. . . .

Books,"21 Lessons for the 21st Century Review “The human mind wants to worry. This is not necessarily a bad thing—after all, if a bear is stalking you, worrying about it may well save your life. Although most of us don’t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days, modern life does present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism, climate change, the rise of A.I., encroachments on our privacy, even the apparent decline of international cooperation. In his fascinating new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the historian Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers, Sapiens and Homo Deus, covered the past and future respectively, his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our anxieties, he suggests, is not to stop worrying. It’s to know which things to worry about, and how much to worry about them. . . . Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. . . .

Books,"The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe From AudioFile Physicist Stephen Hawking suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The condition has progressed to the point where he can no longer speak for himself. Hawking, therefore, uses a voice synthesizer to deliver this series of popular lectures on black holes, current physics theories, and the nature of time and space. The synthesizer paces sentences oddly and slurs an occasional word; Hawking jokes about being unable to get rid of its American accent. However, listeners will soon adapt to the oddities of delivery, and once they do, will find themselves inspired by the sweep and clarity of Hawking's mind, and by his warmth and bravery.

Books,"The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe Amazon.com Review With a title inspired as much by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker series as Einstein, The Theory of Everything delivers almost as much as it promises. Transcribed from Stephen Hawking's Cambridge Lectures, the slim volume may not present a single theory unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces, but it does carefully explain the state of late 20th-century physics with the great scientist's characteristic humility and charm. Explicitly shunning math, Hawking explains the fruits of 100 years of heavy thinking with metaphors that are simple but never condescending--he compares the settling of the newborn universe into symmetry to the formation of ice crystals in a glass of water, for example. While he explores his own work (especially when speaking about black holes), he also discusses the important milestones achieved by others like Richard Feynman. Though occasionally an impenetrably obscure phrase does slip by, the reader will find the bulk of the text enlightening and engaging. The material, from the nature of time to the possibility that the universe has no beginning or end, is rich and deep and inevitably ignites metaphysical thinking. After all, Hawking is famous for his ""we would know the mind of God"" remark, which ends the final lecture herein. --Rob Lightner  From the Publisher Audio version delivered by Stephen W. Hawking using a voice synthesizer machine."

Books,"The Theory of Everything Review Stephen Hawking's The Theory of Everything is a short book that can act as an introduction to the subjects of cosmology raised by modern science, but the book is only that; I preferred his Brief History of Time to this work because it was longer, more detailed, and covered more ground. If you are looking for a very basic introduction to the current thinking of astrophysicists, this is a good book; if you really want to wrestle with the subject at length, you should buy a Brief History of Time, or one of Paul Davies works, such as About Time. If you are looking for a good lecture series on physics, Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces and its sequel, Six Not So Easy Pieces is really the finest of this genre. That being said, the book does a good job in outlining the basic subject matter, discussing the development of the Big Bang theory, and the implications of both the general theory of relativity and quantum physics on the formation of the universe. Hawking is at his best when discussing singularities -- the points of the universe, such as black holes, where the laws of physics break down. --By D. W. Casey on June 27, 2002This is a collection of seven related lectures by Hawking originally published in 1996 under the title, The Cambridge Lectures: Life Works. He does not cover as much ground here as in did in A Brief History of Time, but what he does cover he does so in a charming and engaging style. There are some few statements here that could be interpreted as less than modest--although not by me--and a mistaken prediction or two, which may be a reason that Hawking is not pleased with this book's publication. He might also object to the title, since neither a ""Theory of Everything"" nor a conclusive answer to the origin and fate of the universe are presented. However, Hawking does address these questions, and his expression is interesting to read and has the agreeable characteristic of being laconic. There are no equations in the book, no mathematics as such, and everything is explained in language that would be intelligible to a high school student. There are the usual droll Hawking jokes about God and His intentions, facetious, epigram-like understatements (I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. p. 66) and witty asides about the convergence of politics on physics, as when he mentions a particle accelerator the size of the Solar System that ""would not be funded under current economic conditions."" --By Dennis Littrell on March 23, 2003this is one of the most interesting book . hawking has explained the whole universe very briefly . the book explains following things deeply *ideas about universe *expanding universe *black holes *origin and fate of universe *the direction of time * the theory of everything the book explains everything from beginning to the end of universe. it shows the interaction between science and natural powers. science lovers it will lead ur knowledge to a next level --By Shiva Thakur on 30 Sep 2012 				    	 					 About the Author Stephen Hawking is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and author of A Brief History of Time which was an international bestseller. His other books for the general reader include A Briefer History of Time, the essay collection Black Holes and Baby Universe and The Universe in a Nutshell. In 1963, Hawking contracted motor neurone disease and was given two years to live. Yet he went on to Cambridge to become a brilliant researcher and Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. Since 1979 he has held the post of Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, the chair held by Isaac Newton in 1663. Professor Hawking has over a dozen honorary degrees and was awarded the CBE in 1982. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Science. Stephen Hawking is regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Einstein."

The reflection upon the ends of political action, upon the means of achieving them, upon the possibilities and necessities of political situations, and upon the obligations that political purposes impose, is an intrinsic element of the whole political process. Such thought evolves along with the institutions, the agencies of government, the moral and physical stresses to which it refers and which - one likes at least to believe - it, in some degree, controls."

Who else would choose a chart of ""guitars per capita"" as a proxy for human progress?An immensely cheering book in these anxious times.An assault both on ignorance and pessimism . . . helping countries improve their governance and public health and opening them up to the rule of law and market exchange works. But not by some sort of magic. Because we act. And to this, as Rosling argues, we first have to understand the world we live in.A wonderful guide to an improving world, as well as being a well-stocked source of sound advice as to how to think about factual and statistical claims . . . The book is a pleasure to read - simple, clear, memorable writing - and when you've finished you'll be a lot wiser about the world. You'll also feel rather happier . . . Factfulness - the relaxing peace of mind you get when you have a clearer view of how the world really is . . . I strongly recommend this book.We need more of this way of thinking, both in business and politics. Where better to start than a new book by one of Gates' favourite gurus, the late Swedish statistician Hans Rosling . . . in an age of so-called post-truth, this is a celebration of the all too often repudiated but underlying story of relentless human progress.[Bill] Gates had selected the tomes as his favourite summer reads . . . [which included] feel-good non-fiction . . . celebrating technological progress and genius, such as Hans Rosling's Factfulness. 				    	 					 Book Description 'A hopeful book about the potential for human progress when we work off facts rather than our inherent biases.' BARACK OBAMATimely, short and essential, FACTFULNESS reveals the power of facts in a post-truth world, by late international sensation Hans Rosling ('a true inspiration' - Bill Gates) and his long-term collaborators Ola and Anna.

But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He studies the riddles of everyday life—from cheating and crime to parenting and sports—and reaches conclusions that turn conventional wisdom on its head. Freakonomics is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They set out to explore the inner workings of a crack gang, the truth about real estate agents, the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, and much more. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, they show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives—how people get what they want or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing.

And they are potentially more destructive than other, more obvious culprits, like greedy bankers, sleepy regulators and irresponsible borrowers. Mr. Rajan ... argues that the actions of these players (and others) unfolded on a larger world stage, that was (and is) subject to the imperatives of political economies... [A] serious and thoughtful book.""--New York Times ""In a new book ... entitled Fault Lines, Rajan argues that the initial causes of the breakdown were stagnant wages and rising inequality. With the purchasing power of many middle-class households lagging behind the cost of living, there was an urgent demand for credit. The financial industry, with encouragement from the government, responded by supplying home-equity loans, subprime mortgages, and auto loans... The side effects of unrestrained credit growth turned out to be devastating--a possibility most economists had failed to consider.""--John Cassidy, New Yorker ""The book, published by Princeton University Press, saw off stiff competition from five others on the shortlist, to be chosen as 'the most compelling and enjoyable' business title of 2010. The final intense debate among the seven judges came down to a choice between Fault Lines and Too Big to Fail, Andrew Ross Sorkin's acclaimed minute-by-minute analysis of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The book identifies the flaws that helped cripple the world financial system, prescribes potential remedies, but also warns that unless policymakers push through painful reforms, the world could be plunged into renewed turmoil.""--Financial Times ""The left has figured out who to blame for the financial crisis: Greedy Wall Street bankers, especially at Goldman Sachs. The right has figured it out, too: It was government's fault, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business says it's more complicated: Fault lines along the tectonic plates of the global economy pushed big government and big finance to a financial earthquake. To him, this was a Greek tragedy in which traders and bankers, congressmen and subprime borrowers all played their parts until the drama reached the inevitably painful end. (Mr. Rajan plays Cassandra, of course.) But just when you're about to cast him as a University of Chicago free-market stereotype, he surprises by identifying the widening gap between rich and poor as a big cause of the calamity.""--David Wessel, Wall Street Journal ""[E]xcellent... [Fault Lines] deserve[s] to be widely read in a time when the tendency to blame everything on catch-all terms like 'globalisation' is gaining ground.""--Economist ""[C]onvincing.""--Christopher Caldwell, New York Times Magazine ""Fault Lines is a must-read.""--Nouriel Roubini, Forbes.com ""What if the financial crash of 2008 was really caused by income inequality? Not greedy bankers, not reckless homeowners, but the ever widening-gulf between the rich and the poor? And what if the lack of social services--like health care--made things much, much worse? This is the startling new theory from Raghuram Rajan... [Fault Lines is] especially fascinating because it mixes free-market Chicago School economics with good-government ideas straight out of Obamaland.""--John Richardson, Esquire.com ""A high-powered yet accessible analysis of the financial crisis and its aftermath, Fault Lines was awarded the FT/Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year. Rajan ... was one of the few who warned that the crisis was coming and his book fizzes with striking and thought-provoking ideas.""--Financial Times (FT Critics Pick 2010) ""What caused the crisis? ... There is an embarrassment of causes--especially embarrassing when you recall how few people saw where they might lead. Raghuram Rajan ... was one of the few to sound an alarm before 2007. That gives his novel and sometimes surprising thesis added authority. He argues in his excellent new book that the roots of the calamity go wider and deeper still.""--Clive Crook, Financial Times ""A thought-provoking new book... [Rajan's] voice is worth listening to.""--Martin Wolf, Financial Times ""Few people were able to foresee the recent economic downturn. Raghuram Rajan ... was one of them. This makes his new book, Fault Lines, worthy of consideration amidst the rampant speculation about the causes of the financial crisis... Fault Lines is valuable primarily for its clear explanation of unintended economic consequences from well-meaning government intervention.""--Washington Times ""Rajan's writing is clear and direct.""--James Pressley, Bloomberg News ""Former IMF chief economist Raghuram G. Rajan ... in his new book, Fault Lines, brings together and explains the diverse failings that contributed to the crisis--the fault lines, as he puts it, that were exposed by the events of the past several years. Rajan then puts forward broad policy recommendations to ward off a future problem... Rajan's book takes a comprehensive look at what got us into the crisis and offers an intriguing approach to avoiding another one.""--Phillip Swagel, Finance & Development ""I devoured Raghuram Rajan's Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy in a very short span of time last night. It's brief, well-written, and extremely interesting. I would definitely recommend adding it to your financial crisis reading list.""--Matthew Yglesias, Yglesias blog ""Rajan is worth reading not just because he was correct when few were but also because his writing is clear as a bell, even to nonspecialists.""--Christopher Caldwell, Weekly Standard ""The proposed global reforms that [Rajan] lists in Fault Lines run the gamut from the prosaic to grandiose. Along with revamping Wall Street's pay system, he offers innovative ideas on building capital buffers into the global credit system, obviating much of the need for bailouts of companies deemed too big or too enmeshed in the financial system to fail.""--Barron's ""Economists who can challenge their peers while remaining accessible to the general reader are rare, but Rajan belongs to this elite group. No short summary can do justice to this well-written, insightful, and nuanced study.""--Choice ""In 2007, then-chief IMF economist Raghuram G. Rajan delivered a stark warning to the world's top bankers: financial markets were headed for doom. They laughed it off. In the wake of the collapse that followed, Rajan has written a new book, Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy, that warns the system is doomed to repeat its mistakes. Like many defenders of the market, Rajan urges us not to demonize the bankers. But it's this fiscal conservative's focus on inequality that makes him stand out from the pack. The growing wage gap, he argues, is a hidden driver of financial instability, putting constant pressure on politicians to enact short-term fixes.""--Toronto Star ""The critics are wrong: Raghuram Rajan's analysis of the global financial crisis remains highly relevant and deserves to be widely read... The breadth of Rajan's explanatory framework--which is presented cogently and concisely within 230 pages of text--marks this book apart from many others that tackle the same themes.""--Mark Hannam, Prospect ""Dozens of experts have explored the reasons behind the ongoing global economic turmoil, and Raghuram Rajan provides his own elegant and thoughtful analysis in Fault Lines.""--BizEd ""With Fault Lines, Rajan has made an original diagnosis of the credit crisis, one that goes much further than those of greedy bankers or wasteful mortgage giants such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.""--Christophe De Rijcke, De Tijd (translated from the Dutch by K.C.L.) ""A book that should be the default choice of discerning finance professionals when they enter the store the next time.""--D. Murali, Business Line ""Rajan's Fault Lines is ... expansive and policy-focused and clearly destined to become a must-read on any list of books on the recent global crisis.""--Jahangir Aziz, Business Standard ""Insightful, educative and incredibly gripping, if you want just one book to understand the ongoing global financial crisis and the way forward, Fault Lines it is.""--Gautam Chikermane, Hindustan Times ""Best Crisis Book by an Economist (2010).""--James Pressley, Bloomberg News ""Fault Lines has a strong claim to be the economics book that best caught the spirit of 2010. Raghuram Rajan's receipt of the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs annual business book award only confirmed his book's widespread popularity. It is not hard to see why so many people liked it. Fault Lines eschews hyperbole for a lucid and balanced account of the crisis.""--Fund Strategy ""Rajan ... comes up with original and important long-term remedies... Rajan's book is a bold enterprise in three ways: firstly it aims to explain the US financial crisis by looking at deep, decade-long fractures in economies and societies; secondly it suggests well-known but radical solutions that few dare put forward; and finally it supplies innovative answers to practical questions... [T]he book will please any reader looking for an inquiry into the deepest causes of the recession and a consistent account of government's errors of omission and commission.""--Natacha Postel-Vinay, British Politics and Policy ""[Fault Lines]'s great strength is that it is a clearly written work of political economy, accessible to readers who do not have a PhD in economics or finance. Its objective is not to point fingers at the guilty, and it comes to some surprising conclusions.""--Stewart Fleming, European Voice ""Fault Lines is a very well written and cogent book that provides a global perspective on the causes of the crisis, the dangers if the root causes of it are not addressed, possible solutions, and ideas for implementing them... In sum, this book is a must read for analysts, academics, politicians, economists, and the like.""--Emilia Garcia-Appendini, Financial Markets and Portfolio Management 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap ""Fault Lines provides an excellent analysis of the lessons to be learned from the financial crisis, and the difficult choices that lie ahead. Of the many books written in the wake of our recent economic meltdown, this is the one that gets it right.""--George A. Akerlof, coauthor of Animal Spirits and Identity Economics""Amidst the welter of books about our financial crisis, Rajan's book stands out for several reasons: the author's intellectual distinction, his academic and real-world involvement in the problems of finance and the macroeconomy, his global perspective, his search for the roots of the financial crisis in America's growing economic inequality, and also his prescience. In 2005, Rajan foresaw the coming financial collapse--and was fiercely criticized for his insight.""--Richard A. Posner, author ofA Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression""Beautifully clear, cogent, and highly readable. This is the best book out there on the global imbalances that gave us the last financial crisis and might well give us the next one.""--Kenneth S.

At last I realized that they did not see.... -SHAMS OF TABRIZPrologue    Between your fingers you hold a stone and throw it into flowing water. The effect might not be easy to see. There will be a small ripple where the stone breaks the surface and then a splash, muffled by the rush of the surrounding river. That’s all.Throw a stone into a lake. The effect will be not only visible but also far more lasting. The stone will disrupt the still waters. A circle will form where the stone hit the water, and in a flash that circle will multiply into another, then another. Before long the ripples caused by one plop will expand until they can be felt everywhere along the mirrored surface of the water. Only when the circles reach the shore will they stop and die out.If a stone hits a river, the river will treat it as yet another commotion in its already tumultuous course. Nothing unusual. Nothing unmanageable.If a stone hits a lake, however, the lake will never be the same again.For forty years Ella Rubinstein’s life had consisted of still waters—a predictable sequence of habits, needs, and preferences. Though it was monotonous and ordinary in many ways, she had not found it tiresome. During the last twenty years, every wish she had, every person she befriended, and every decision she made was filtered through her marriage. Her husband, David, was a successful dentist who worked hard and made a lot of money. She had always known that they did not connect on any deep level, but connecting emotionally need not be a priority on a married couple’s list, she thought, especially for a man and a woman who had been married for so long. There were more important things than passion and love in a marriage, such as understanding, affection, compassion, and that most godlike act a person could perform, forgiveness. Love was secondary to any of these. Unless, that is, one lived in novels or romantic movies, where the protagonists were always larger than life and their love nothing short of legend.Ella’s children topped her list of priorities. They had a beautiful daughter in college, Jeannette, and teenage twins, Orly and Avi. Also, they had a twelve-year-old golden retriever, Spirit, who had been Ella’s walking buddy in the mornings and her cheeriest companion ever since he’d been a puppy. Now he was old, overweight, completely deaf, and almost blind; Spirit’s time was coming, but Ella preferred to think he would go on forever. Then again, that was how she was. She never confronted the death of anything, be it a habit, a phase, or a marriage, even when the end stood right in front of her, plain and inevitable.The Rubinsteins lived in Northampton, Massachusetts, in a large Victorian house that needed some renovation but still was splendid, with five bedrooms, three baths, shiny hardwood floors, a three-car garage, French doors, and, best of all, an outdoor Jacuzzi. They had life insurance, car insurance, retirement plans, college savings plans, joint bank accounts, and, in addition to the house they lived in, two prestigious apartments: one in Boston, the other in Rhode Island. She and David had worked hard for all this. A big, busy house with children, elegant furniture, and the wafting scent of homemade pies might seem a cliché to some people, but to them it was the picture of an ideal life. They had built their marriage around this shared vision and had attained most, if not all, of their dreams.On their last Valentine’s Day, her husband had given her a heart-shaped diamond pendant and a card that read,To my dear Ella, A woman with a quiet manner, a generous heart, and the patience of a saint. Thank you for accepting me as I am. Thank you for being my wife. Yours,DavidElla had never confessed this to David, but reading his card had felt like reading an obituary. This is what they will write about me when I die, she had thought. And if they were sincere, they might also add this:Building her whole life around her husband and children, Ella lacked any survival techniques to help her cope with life’s hardships on her own. She was not the type to throw caution to the wind. Even changing her daily coffee brand was a major effort.All of which is why no one, including Ella, could explain what was going on when she filed for divorce in the fall of 2008 after twenty years of marriage.But there was a reason: love.They did not live in the same city. Not even on the same continent. The two of them were not only miles apart but also as different as day and night. Their lifestyles were so dissimilar that it seemed impossible for them to bear each other’s presence, never mind fall in love. But it happened. And it happened fast, so fast in fact that Ella had no time to realize what was happening and to be on guard, if one could ever be on guard against love.Love came to Ella as suddenly and brusquely as if a stone had been hurled from out of nowhere into the tranquil pond of her life.Ella    NORTHAMPTON, MAY 17, 2008 Birds were singing outside her kitchen window on that balmy day in spring. Afterward Ella replayed the scene in her mind so many times that, rather than a fragment from the past, it felt like an ongoing moment still happening somewhere out there in the universe.There they were, sitting around the table, having a late family lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Her husband was filling his plate with fried chicken legs, his favorite food. Avi was playing his knife and fork like drumsticks while his twin, Orly, was trying to calculate how many bites of which food she could eat so as not to ruin her diet of 650 calories a day. Jeannette, who was a freshman at Mount Holyoke College nearby, seemed lost in her thoughts as she spread cream cheese on another slice of bread. Also at the table sat Aunt Esther, who had stopped by to drop off one of her famous marble cakes and then stayed on for lunch. Ella had a lot of work to do afterward, but she was not ready to leave the table just yet. Lately they didn’t have too many shared family meals, and she saw this as a golden chance for everyone to reconnect.“Esther, did Ella give you the good news?” David asked suddenly. “She found a great job.”Though Ella had graduated with a degree in English literature and loved fiction, she hadn’t done much in the field after college, other than editing small pieces for women’s magazines, attending a few book clubs, and occasionally writing book reviews for some local papers. That was all. There was a time when she’d aspired to become a prominent book critic, but then she simply accepted the fact that life had carried her elsewhere, turning her into an industrious housewife with three kids and endless domestic responsibilities.Not that she complained. Being the mother, the wife, the dog walker, and the housekeeper kept her busy enough. She didn’t have to be a breadwinner on top of all these. Though none of her feminist friends from Smith College approved of her choice, she was satisfied to be a stay-at-home mom and grateful that she and her husband could afford it. Besides, she had never abandoned her passion for books and still considered herself a voracious reader.A few years ago, things had begun to change. The children were growing up, and they made it clear that they didn’t need her as much as they once had. Realizing that she had too much time to spare and no one to spend it with, Ella had considered how it might be to find a job. David had encouraged her, but though they kept talking and talking about it, she rarely pursued the opportunities that came her way, and when she did, potential employers were always looking for someone younger or more experienced. Afraid of being rejected over and over, she had simply let the subject drop.Nevertheless, in May 2008 whatever obstacle had impeded her from finding a job all these years unexpectedly vanished. Two weeks shy of her fortieth birthday, she found herself working for a literary agency based in Boston. It was her husband who found her the job through one of his clients—or perhaps through one of his mistresses.“Oh, it’s no big deal,” Ella rushed to explain now. “I’m only a part-time reader for a literary agent.”But David seemed determined not to let her think too little of her new job. “Come on, tell them it’s a well-known agency,” he urged, nudging her, and when she refused to comply, he heartily agreed with himself. “It’s a prestigious place, Esther. You should see the other assistants! Girls and boys fresh out of the best colleges. Ella is the only one going back to work after being a housewife for years. Now, isn’t she something?”Ella wondered if, deep inside, her husband felt guilty about keeping her away from a career, or else about cheating on her—these being the only two explanations she could think of as to why he was now going overboard in his enthusiasm.Still smiling, David concluded, “This is what I call chutzpah. We’re all proud of her.”“She is a prize. Always was,” said Aunt Esther in a voice so sentimental that it sounded as if Ella had left the table and was gone for good.They all gazed at her lovingly. Even Avi didn’t make a cynical remark, and Orly for once seemed to care about something other than her looks. Ella forced herself to appreciate this moment of kindness, but she felt an overwhelming exhaustion that she had never experienced before. She secretly prayed for someone to change the subject.Jeannette, her older daughter, must have heard the prayer, for she suddenly chimed in, “I have some good news, too.”All heads turned toward her, faces beaming with expectation.“Scott and I have decided to get married,” Jeannette announced. “Oh, I know what you guys are going to say! That we haven’t finished college yet and all that, but you’ve got to understand, we both feel ready for the next big move.”An awkward silence descended upon the kitchen table as the warmth that had canopied them just a moment ago evaporated. Orly and Avi exchanged blank looks, and Aunt Esther froze with her hand tightened around a glass of apple juice. David put his fork aside as if he had no appetite left and squinted at Jeannette with his light brown eyes that were deeply creased with smile lines at the corners. However, right now he was anything but smiling. His mouth had drawn into a pout, as though he had just downed a swig of vinegar.“Great! I expected you to share my happiness, but I get this cold treatment instead,” Jeannette whined.“You just said you were getting married,” remarked David as ifJeannette didn’t know what she’d said and needed to be informed.“Dad, I know it seems a bit too soon, but Scott proposed to me the other day and I’ve already said yes.”“But why?” asked Ella.From the way Jeannette looked at her, Ella reckoned, that was not the kind of question her daughter had expected. She would rather have been asked “When?” or “How?” In either case it meant that she could start shopping for her wedding dress. The question “Why?” was another matter altogether and had completely caught her off guard.“Because I love him, I guess.” Jeannette’s tone was slightly condescending.“Honey, what I meant was, why the rush?” insisted Ella. “Are you pregnant or something?”Aunt Esther twitched in her chair, her face stern, her anguish visible. She took an antacid tablet from her pocket and started chewing on it.“I’m going to be an uncle,” Avi said, giggling.Ella held Jeannette’s hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. “You can always tell us the truth. You know that, right? We’ll stand by you no matter what.”“Mom, will you please stop that?” Jeannette snapped as she pulled her hand away. “This has nothing to do with pregnancy. You’re embarrassing me.”“I was just trying to help,” Ella responded calmly, calmness being a state she had been lately finding harder and harder to achieve.“By insulting me, you mean. Apparently the only way you can see Scott and me getting married is me being knocked up! Does it ever occur to you that I might, just might, want to marry this guy because I love him? We have been dating for eight months now.”This elicited a scoff from Ella. “Oh, yeah, as if you could tell a man’s character in eight months! Your father and I have been married for almost twenty years, and even we can’t claim to know everything about each other. Eight months is nothing in a relationship!”“It took God only six days to create the entire universe,” said Avi, beaming, but cold stares from everyone at the table forced him back into silence.Sensing the escalating tension, David, his eyes fixed on his elder daughter, his brow furrowed in thought, interjected, “Honey, what your mom is trying to say is that dating is one thing, marrying is quite another.”“But, Dad, did you think we would date forever?” Jeannette asked.Drawing in a deep breath, Ella said, “To be perfectly blunt, we were expecting you to find someone better. You’re too young to get involved in any serious relationship.”“You know what I’m thinking, Mom?” Jeannette said in a voice so flat as to be unrecognizable. “I’m thinking you’re projecting your own fears onto me. But just because you married so young and had a baby when you were my age, that doesn’t mean I’m going to make the same mistake.”Ella blushed crimson as if slapped in the face. From deep within she remembered the difficult pregnancy that had resulted in Jeannette’s premature birth. As a baby and then as a toddler, her daughter had drained all of her energy, which was why she had waited six years before getting pregnant again.“Sweetheart, we were happy for you when you started dating Scott,” David said cautiously, trying a different strategy. “He’s a nice guy. But who knows what you’ll be thinking after graduation? Things might be very different then.”Jeannette gave a small nod that conveyed little more than feigned acquiescence. Then she said, “Is this because Scott isn’t Jewish?”David rolled his eyes in disbelief. He had always taken pride in being an open-minded and cultured father, avoiding negative remarks about race, religion, or gender in the house.Jeannette, however, seemed relentless. Turning to her mother, she asked, “Can you look me in the eye and tell me you’d still be making the same objections if Scott were a young Jewish man named Aaron?”Jeannette’s voice needled with bitterness and sarcasm, and Ella feared there was more of that welling up inside her daughter.“Sweetheart, I’ll be completely honest with you, even if you might not like it. I know how wonderful it is to be young and in love. Believe me, I do. But to get married to someone from a different background is a big gamble. And as your parents we want to make sure you’re doing the right thing.”“And how do you know your right thing is the right thing for me?”The question threw Ella off a little. She sighed and massaged her forehead, as if on the verge of a migraine.“I love him, Mom. Does that mean anything to you? Do you remember that word from somewhere? He makes my heart beat faster. I can’t live without him.”Ella heard herself chuckle. It was not her intention to make fun of her daughter’s feelings, not at all, but that was probably what her laughing to herself sounded like. For reasons unknown to her, she felt extremely nervous. She’d had fights with Jeannette before, hundreds of them, but today it felt as though she were quarreling with something else, something bigger.“Mom, haven’t you ever been in love?” Jeannette retorted, a hint of contempt creeping into her tone.“Oh, give me a break! Stop daydreaming and get real, will you? You’re being so ... ” Ella’s eyes darted toward the window, hunting for a dramatic word, until finally she came up with “ . . . romantic!”“What’s wrong with being romantic?” Jeannette asked, sounding offended.Really, what was wrong with being romantic? Ella wondered. Since when was she so annoyed by romanticism? Unable to answer the questions tugging at the edges of her mind, she continued all the same. “Come on, honey. Which century are you living in? Just get it in your head, women don’t marry the men they fall in love with. When push comes to shove, they choose the guy who’ll be a good father and a reliable husband. Love is only a sweet feeling bound to come and quickly go away.”When she finished talking, Ella turned to her husband. David had clasped his hands in front of him, slowly as if through water, and was looking at her like he’d never seen her before.“I know why you’re doing this,” Jeannette said. “You’re jealous of my happiness and my youth. You want to make an unhappy housewife out of me. You want me to be you, Mom.”Ella felt a strange, sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach, as if she had a giant rock sitting there. Was she an unhappy housewife? A middle-aged mom trapped in a failing marriage? Was this how her children saw her? And her husband, too? What about friends and neighbors? Suddenly she had the feeling that everyone around her secretly pitied her, and the suspicion was so painful that she gasped.“You should apologize to your mom,” David said, turning to Jeannette with a frown on his face.“It’s all right. I don’t expect an apology,” Ella said dejectedly.Jeannette gave her mother a mock leer. And just like that, she pushed back her chair, threw her napkin aside, and walked out of the kitchen. After a minute Orly and Avi silently followed suit, either in an unusual act of solidarity with their elder sister or because they’d gotten bored of all this adult talk. Aunt Esther left next, mumbling some poor excuse while chewing fiercely on her last antacid tablet.David and Ella remained at the table, an intense awkwardness hanging in the air between them. It pained Ella to have to face this void, which, as they both knew, had nothing to do with Jeannette or any of their children.David grabbed the fork he had put aside and inspected it for a while. “So should I conclude that you didn’t marry the man you loved?”“Oh, please, that’s not what I meant.”“What is it you meant, then?” David said, still talking to the fork. “I thought you were in love with me when we got married.”“I was in love with you,” Ella said, but couldn’t help adding, “back then.”“So when did you stop loving me?” David asked, deadpan.Ella looked at her husband in astonishment, like someone who had never seen her reflection before and who now held a mirror to her face. Had she stopped loving him? It was a question she had never asked herself before. She wanted to respond but lacked not so much the will as the words. Deep inside she knew it was the two of them they should be concerned about, not their children. But instead they were doing what they both were best at: letting the days go by, the routine take over, and time run its course of inevitable torpor.She started to cry, unable to hold back this continuing sadness that had, without her knowledge, become a part of who she was. David turned his anguished face away. They both knew he hated to see her cry just as much as she hated to cry in front of him. Fortunately, the phone rang just then, saving them.David picked it up. “Hello . . . yes, she’s here. Hold on, please.”Ella pulled herself together and spoke up, doing her best to sound in good spirits. “Yes, this is Ella.”“Hi, this is Michelle. Sorry to bother you over the weekend,” chirped a young woman’s voice. “It’s just that yesterday Steve wanted me to check in with you, and I simply forgot. Did you have a chance to start working on the manuscript?”“Oh.” Ella sighed, only now remembering the task awaiting her.Her first assignment at the literary agency was to read a novel by an unknown European author. She was then expected to write an extensive report on it.“Tell him not to worry. I’ve already started reading,” Ella lied. Ambitious and headstrong, Michelle was the kind of person she didn’t want to upset on her first assignment.“Oh, good! How is it?”Ella paused, puzzled as to what to say. She didn’t know anything about the manuscript, except that it was a historical novel centered on the life of the famous mystic poet Rumi, who she learned was called “the Shakespeare of the Islamic world.”“Oh, it’s very . . . mystical.” Ella chuckled, hoping to cover with a joke.But Michelle was all business. “Right,” she said flatly. “Listen, I think you need to get on this. It might take longer than you expect to write a report on a novel like that. . . . ”There was a distant muttering on the phone as Michelle’s voice trailed off. Ella imagined her juggling several tasks simultaneously—checking e-mails, reading a review on one of her authors, taking a bite from her tuna-salad sandwich, and polishing her fingernails—all while talking on the phone.“Are you still there?” Michelle asked a minute later.“Yes, I am.”“Good. Listen, it’s crazy in here. I need to go. Just keep in mind the deadline is in three weeks.”“I know,” Ella said abruptly, trying to sound more determined. “I’ll make the deadline.”The truth was, Ella wasn’t sure she wanted to evaluate this manuscript at all. In the beginning she’d been so eager and confident. It had felt thrilling to be the first one to read an unpublished novel by an unknown author and to play however small a role in his fate. But now she wasn’t sure if she could concentrate on a subject as irrelevant to her life as Sufism and a time as distant as the thirteenth century.Michelle must have detected her hesitation. “Is there a problem?” she asked. When no answer came, she grew insistent. “Listen, you can confide in me.”After a bit of silence, Ella decided to tell her the truth.“It’s just that I’m not sure I’m in the right state of mind these days to concentrate on a historical novel. I mean, I’m interested in Rumi and all that, but still, the subject is alien to me. Perhaps you could give me another novel—you know, something I could more easily relate to.”“That’s such a skewed approach,” said Michelle. “You think you can work better with books you know something about? Not at all! Just because you live in this state, you can’t expect to edit only novels that take place in Massachusetts, right?”“That’s not what I meant . . .” Ella said, and immediately realized she had uttered the same sentence too many times this afternoon. She glanced at her husband to see if he, too, had noticed this, but David’s expression was hard to decipher.“Most of the time, we have to read books that have nothing to do with our lives. That’s part of our job. Just this week I finished working on a book by an Iranian woman who used to operate a brothel in Tehran and had to flee the country. Should I have told her to send the manuscript to an Iranian agency instead?”“No, of course not,” Ella mumbled, feeling silly and guilty.“Isn’t connecting people to distant lands and cultures one of the strengths of good literature?”“Sure it is. Listen, forget what I said. You’ll have a report on your desk before the deadline,” Ella conceded, hating Michelle for treating her as if she were the dullest person alive and hating herself for allowing this to happen.“Wonderful, that’s the spirit,” Michelle concluded in her singsong voice. “Don’t get me wrong, but I think you should bear in mind that there are dozens of people out there who would love to have your job. And most of them are almost half your age. That’ll keep you motivated.”When Ella hung up the phone, she found David watching her, his face solemn and reserved. He seemed to be waiting for them to pick up where they’d left off. But she didn’t feel like mulling over their daughter’s future anymore, if that was what they’d been worrying about in the first place.Later in the day, she was alone on the porch sitting in her favorite rocking chair, looking at the orangey-red Northampton sunset. The sky felt so close and open that you could almost touch it. Her brain had gone quiet, as if tired of all the noise swirling inside. This month’s credit-card payments, Orly’s bad eating habits, Avi’s poor grades, Aunt Esther and her sad cakes, her dog Spirit’s decaying health, Jeannette’s marriage plans, her husband’s secret flings, the absence of love in her life . . . One by one, she locked them all in small mental boxes.In that frame of mind, Ella took the manuscript out of its package and bounced it in her hand, as if weighing it. The title of the novel was written on the cover in indigo ink: Sweet Blasphemy.Ella had been told that nobody knew much about the author—a certain A. Z. Zahara, who lived in Holland. His manuscript had been shipped to the literary agency from Amsterdam with a postcard inside the envelope. On the front of the postcard was a picture of tulip fields in dazzling pinks, yellows, and purples, and on the back a note written in delicate handwriting:Dear Sir/Madam, Greetings from Amsterdam. The story I herewith send you takes place in thirteenth-century Konya in Asia Minor. But I sincerely believe that it cuts across countries, cultures, and centuries.I hope you will have the time to read SWEET BLASPHEMY, a historical, mystical novel on the remarkable bond between Rumi, the best poet and most revered spiritual leader in the history of Islam, and Shams of Tabriz, an unknown, unconventional dervish full of scandals and surprises.May love be always with you and you always surrounded with love.A. Z. Zahara"

""Circe,' [is] a bold and subversive retelling of the goddess's story that manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right.""―Alexandra Alter, New York Times""One of the most amazing qualities of this novel [is]: We know how everything here turns out - we've known it for thousands of years - and yet in Miller's lush reimagining, the story feels harrowing and unexpected. The feminist light she shines on these events never distorts their original shape; it only illuminates details we hadn't noticed before.""―Ron Charles, Washington Post""[Miller] gives voice to Circe as a multifaceted and evolving character...'Circe' is very pleasurable to read, combining lively versions of familiar tales and snippets of other, related standards with a highly psychologized, redemptive and ultimately exculpatory account of the protagonist herself.""―Claire Messud, New York Times Book Review""The story of Circe's entanglement with Odysseus lasts far beyond the narrative of ""The Odyssey,"" making for compelling material to revisit. But ultimately it's as a character that Circe stands apart....Through her elegant, psychologically acute prose, Miller gives us a rich female character who inhabits the spaces in between.""―Colleen Abel, Minneapolis Star Tribune""Miller's lush, gold-lit novel - told from the perspective of the witch whose name in Greek has echoes of a hawk and a weaver's shuttle - paints another picture: of a fierce goddess who, yes, turns men into pigs, but only because they deserve it.""―NPR.org ""so vivid, so layered, you could get lost in it...

Books,"Circe: The Sunday Times Bestseller Review Circe gives us a feminist slant on the Odyssey ... Miller makes these age-old texts thrum with contemporary relevance ... An airy delight, a novel to be gobbled greedily in a single sitting * Observer * Enough magic, enchantment, voyages and wonders to satisfy the most jaded sword-and-sorcery palate. Miller approaches Odysseus's story from Circe's point of view, richly evoking her protagonist's overlapping identities as goddess, witch, lover and mother -- Adam Roberts * Guardian, Books of the Year * Circe back as superwoman ... Homer's witch get a kickass modern makeover... Miller's Me Too-era, kickass portrait of a woman trying to defy the men and Fates arrayed against her is enchanting... Blisteringly modern * The Times * In a thrilling tour de force of imagination, Miller makes her otherworldly heroine a complex, sympathetic figure for whom we cheer throughout. Circe is a truly spellbinding novel, the mesmerising shimmer of ancient magic rising from it like a heat haze * Mail on Sunday * A brilliantly strange work of mythic science fiction, as effortlessly expressive within the palaces of gods as it is about the world below ... Superb ... This is both a fabulous novel and a fascinating retelling; the best compliment, perhaps, that any myth could hope for * Daily Telegraph * A triumph * The Times, Books of the Year * Circe is poised to become the literary sensation of the summer, as much for the quality of its writing as its timeliness * Sunday Times Magazine * This year's novels were filled with the angry clamour of women's voices: ignored, idealistic or excitingly ambivalent. Madeline Miller reflected the mood for feminist revisionism with her lissom follow-up Circe, which casts the witch goddess in the Odyssey not as a bit player in a man's epic but as the star of her own show -- Claire Allfree * Daily Telegraph, Books of the Year * It was a big year for creative retelling of myth and pre-modern literature; a favourite was Madeline Miller's Circe, a distinctive, lyrical novel about power, agency and reponsibility, from the point of view of this crafty, much-misunderstood goddess -- Emily Wilson * Times Literary Supplement, Books of the Year * The writing is lovely, the tone assured, and the touch just right -- Alexander McCall Smith * Independent, Books of the Year * It is out of these insights that Miller achieves real narrative propulsion ... Supple, pitched in a register that bridges man and myth * Guardian * The first witch in Western literature sets Homer straight as she tells her life story, from her unhappy childhood to her lonely island exile. The woman who emerges is complex and sympathetic. A spellbinding tour de force of imagination * Mail on Sunday, `Sizzling summer reads' * Miller has effected a transformation just as impressive as any of her heroine's own: she's turned an ancient tale of female subjugation into one of empowerment and courage full of contemporary resonances -- Lucy Scholes * Independent * What more could you wish for on holiday than this fabulously written re-imagining of the myth? Gods, monsters and mortals are lushly evoked in a page-turner that is as gripping as a soap opera and which triumphantly fuses myth with our contemporary concerns -- Elizabeth Buchan * Daily Mail, Books of the Summer 2018 * Dubbed the `feminist Odyssey', there's so much to like about Circe. From the author of the much-loved The Song of Achilles, this novel puts a feminist spin on Greek mythology, recasting Circe, the vilified witch infamous for turning men into pigs, in a sympathetic light. Subverting the usual masculine tropes of epic adventure narratives, Miller tells the story of the women who have been historically silenced. And on top of that, she makes Greek myths and culture, which is often perceived as impenetrable and intimidating, accessible. A real page-turner * Elle Magazine * Illuminates known stories from a new perspective ... Miller has determined, in her characterization of this most powerful witch, to bring her as close as possible to the human, as a thoughtful and compassionate woman who learns to love unselfishly ... A highly psychologized, redemptive and ultimately exculpatory account of the protagonist herself -- Claire Messud * New York Times * The Orange prizewinner Madeline Miller reimagines Circe, the witch from The Odyssey. In Miller's retelling Circe is a suitably bolshie character who is not going to be bossed around by men. The writing is beautiful * The Times * An epic that's also a page-turner * i * Fabulous ... Bold and sensuously written, it plays brilliantly with the original myth of Circe * Daily Mail * I've been waiting for Circe by Madeline Miller for what feels like forever. Since her 2011 debut, The Song of Achilles - a queer retelling of the Iliad from Patroclus' perspective - I've been crowing about the wit and magic of Miller's prose. Circe did not disappoint. It's a feminist tale of the nymph child of Helios, the sun god, who is exiled for practising witchcraft. Circe lives for hundreds of years, encountering heroes, gods and legends, but it never feels like a Greek mythology lesson. Actually, it feels more like a splashy, gossipy memoir written by a celebrity who has met everyone. I suspect this will be my book of the year -- Caroline O'Donoghue * Irish Times * Greek myth is fertile fictional terrain for Miller, who won the Orange Prize with her debut, The Song of Achilles. Her new novel is narrated by Circe, the witch from Homer's Odyssey, who is banished to a remote island and there learns how to survive as a woman alone in the world -- Anita Sethi * Independent, Books of 2018 * A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess's story that manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right * New York Times * The Song of Achilles was a big hit; Circe will be, too * Sunday Times * [Miller] gives voice to Circe as a multifaceted and evolving character ... Circe is very pleasurable to read, combining lively versions of familiar tales and snippets of other, related standards with a highly psychologized, redemptive and ultimately exculpatory account of the protagonist herself * New York Times Book Review * God though she may be, here she faces life - and its love, heartbreak, loneliness and motherhood - with immensely relatable humanity. The definition of female strength in all its fractured, fragile glory * **** Stylist * Offers opportunities for feminist revision of famous characters both mortal and divine, especially the egotistical Odysseus and the irresponsible and laddish Hermes. It also leads to a suspenseful metaphysical dilemma ... Polished diction and descriptive powers * Prospect * Absorbing ... One of the most amazing qualities of this novel [is]: We know how everything here turns out -we've known it for thousands of years - and yet in Miller's lush reimagining, the story feels harrowing and unexpected. The feminist light she shines on these events never distorts their original shape; it only illuminates details we hadn't noticed before... In the story that dawns from Miller's rosy fingers, the fate that awaits Circe is at once divine and mortal, impossibility strange and yet entirely human * Washington Post * A look at mythology with fresh eyes ... In Circe the female perspective sharpens into focus in a way that doesn't happen in the original * Wall Street Journal * Miller excels at reworking myths and legends for a modern audience ... Miller conjures up a cast of strong, relatable characters, from cold-hearted gods and flawed heroes to deadly monsters-and best of all-a strong female protagonist. Fabulously readable * Scotsman * Beautifully written throughout ... Miller has broken [Circe] free of the conventions of the masculine epic * Literary Review * A refreshingly complex and utterly compelling portrait of one of the most intriguing women in western literature ... Miller's depiction of what it feels like to work magic is extraordinarily vivid and convincing ... What elevates Circe is Miller's luminous prose, which is both enormously readable and evocative, and the way in which she depicts the gulf between gods and mortals ... Circe can be part of that cycle of cruel and pointless conflict, or she can choose to break it. In this unforgettable novel, Miller makes us care about that magical, mythical choice * Irish Times * This is a gorgeous retelling of Homer's Odyssey blended with other legends. Miller creates a magical narrative: strong relatable characters, cold-hearted gods, flawed heroes, deadly monsters, and best of all, a strong female protagonist. Overall, it is fabulously readable * Herald * In Circe, Miller gives depth and history to the title character, how it was she came to be on her island, and her struggles as an independent woman. The ""heroes"" of Greek myths - the gods, Odysseus and so on - get shoved to the side, as Miller brings to the forefront a fascinating, captivating female character. This is wonderfully detailed and well worth the more than five year wait since The Song of Achilles * Stylist, The 20 must-read books to make room for in 2018 * A mesmerising, fiercely feminist and lyrical retelling of a story from Greek mythology - as enchanting as the enchantress herself * Psychologies * Circe is the utterly captivating, exquisitely written story of an ordinary, and extraordinary, woman's life -- Eimear McBride, author of A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing An epic spanning thousands of years that's also a keep-you-up-all-night page turner -- Ann Patchett Captivating ... Will entertain and enchant * Sunday Express Magazine * Horror, heartache and grit pour from the pages of this exquisitely written and compelling novel. An alchemist with words, Miller continues to rejuvenate the classics with her exceptional talent ... Circe is one of the best and most rewarding books of 2018 * Attitude, 'Book of the Month' * Dazzling * Woman & Home * Gives Greek mythology a modern, feminist twist * Elle * Even better than its predecessor. Written in supple, imaginative prose, it conjures up brilliantly a vivid world in which the lives of gods and mortals are intimately intertwined * BBC History Magazine * Miller weaves an intoxicating tale of gods and heroes, magic and monsters, survival and transformation * i * A life-affirming tale of astonishing beauty ... A sensuous, thrilling experience, combining exquisite prose with high drama ... The pettiness and casual brutality of the deities is sadly recognisable in modern political times, while Circe's quest for validation will ring a chord with men and women alike * Toast Book Club * With her classicist's ear, Miller infuses her prose with Homeric rhythms, to mischievous and lovely effect. With nods to a wealth of ancient works, she crafts her own triumphant Circe ... Miller's Circe is a shrewd and cool character, capable of great love but also possessed of a lethally ruthless streak. Her mixture of assiduous domesticity and merciless witchcraft is addictively conveyed * The Lady * The exiled witch, who barely gets more than a mention in Homer's The Odyssey, is at the centre of a page-turning feminist romp * The Pool, Summer Reads 2018 * Miss Miller leaves us utterly bewitched * Country Life * Gorgeously written ... It leaves you thinking about it for weeks * Grazia * Madeline Miller's Circe stood out for me as hugely enjoyable, powerfully entertaining read, full of ruthless gods and unreliable mortals, in which the author (an American classics teacher) reimagines Circe as a damaged girl who uses witchcraft to protect herself from swinish men and discovers the ultimate power of human love -- Anne Chisholm * Tablet, Books of the Year * 				    	 					 About the Author Madeline Miller is the author of The Song of Achilles, which won the Orange Prize for Fiction 2012, was shortlisted for the Stonewall Writer of the Year 2012, was an instant New York Times bestseller, and was translated into twenty-five languages.

Books,"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas From Booklist Gr. 7-10. Some of the most thought-provoking Holocaust books are about bystanders, including those who say they did not know what was happening. This first novel tells the bystander story from the viewpoint of an innocent child. Bruno is nine when his family moves from their luxurious Berlin home to the country, where ""the Fury"" has appointed Bruno's father commandant. Lost and lonely, the child hates the upheaval, while his stern but kind father celebrates his success because he has learned to follow orders. Bruno can see a concentration camp in the distance, but he has no idea what is going on, even when he eventually meets and makes friends with Shmuel, a boy from Cracow, who lives on the other side of the camp fence.

It is time for us all to join his 'non-movement.'""—Keri Smith author of How to be an Explorer of the World “Japan’s most celebrated alternative farmer...Fukuoka’s vision offers a beacon, a goal, an ideal to strive for.” —Tom Philpott, Grist “The One-Straw Revolution shows the critical role of locally based agroecological knowledge in developing sustainable farming systems.” —Sustainable Architecture “With no ploughing, weeding, fertilizers, external compost, pruning or chemicals, his minimalist approach reduces labour time to a fifth of more conventional practices. Yet his success in yields is comparable to more resource-intensive methods…The method is now being widely adopted to vegetate arid areas.

He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for number of years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II, he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production, managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war, he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975, distressed by the effects of Japan’s post-war modernization, Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years, Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties, and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Frances Moore Lappé is author or co-author of sixteen books, including Diet for a Small Planet and Getting a Grip: Clarity, Creativity, and Courage in a World Gone Mad.

Books,"Cosmos Amazon.com Review Cosmos was the first science TV blockbuster, and Carl Sagan was its (human) star. By the time of Sagan's death in 1996, the series had been seen by half a billion people; Sagan was perhaps the best-known scientist on the planet. Explaining how the series came about, Sagan recalled: I was positive from my own experience that an enormous global interest exists in the exploration of the planets and in many kindred scientific topics--the origin of life, the Earth, and the Cosmos, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, our connection with the universe. And I was certain that this interest could be excited through that most powerful communications medium, television. Sagan's own interest and enthusiasm for the universe were so vivid and infectious, his screen presence so engaging, that viewers and readers couldn't help but be caught up in his vision. From stars in their ""billions and billions"" to the amino acids in the primordial ocean, Sagan communicated a feeling for science as a process of discovery. Inevitably, some of the science in Cosmos has been outdated in the years since 1980--but Sagan's sense of wonder is ageless. --Mary Ellen Curtin  Review “Magnificent . . . With a lyrical literary style, and a range that touches almost all aspects of human knowledge, Cosmos often seems too good to be true.”—The Plain Dealer“Sagan is an astronomer with one eye on the stars, another on history, and a third—his mind’s—on the human condition.”—Newsday“Brilliant in its scope and provocative in its suggestions . . . shimmers with a sense of wonder.”—The Miami Herald“Sagan dazzles the mind with the miracle of our survival, framed by the stately galaxies of space.”—Cosmopolitan“Enticing . . . iridescent . . . imaginatively illustrated.”—The New York Times Book Review               See all Product description"

Books,"One-straw Revolution: Introduction to Natural Farming Review The One-Straw Revolution is one of the founding documents of the alternative food movement, and indispensable to anyone hoping to understand the future of food and agriculture. Michael Pollan Fukuoka's do-nothing approach to farming is not only revolutionary in terms of growing food, but it is also applicable to other aspects of living, (creativity, child-rearing, activism, career, etc.) His holistic message is needed now more than ever as we search for new ways of approaching the environment, our community and life. It is time for us all to join his 'non-movement. Keri Smith author of How to be an Explorer of the World Japan s most celebrated alternative farmer...Fukuoka s vision offers a beacon, a goal, an ideal to strive for. Tom Philpott, The One-Straw Revolution shows the critical role of locally based agroecological knowledge in developing sustainable farming systems. Sustainable Architecture With no ploughing, weeding, fertilizers, external compost, pruning or chemicals, his minimalist approach reduces labour time to a fifth of more conventional practices. Yet his success in yields is comparable to more resource-intensive methods...The method is now being widely adopted to vegetate arid areas.

New Internationalist. --New Internationalist 				    	 					 About the Author Masanobu Fukuoka (1913 2008) was born and raised on the Japanese island of Shikoku. He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for number of years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II, he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production, managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war, he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975, distressed by the effects of Japan s post-war modernization, Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years, Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties, and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Frances Moore Lappé is author or co-author of sixteen books, including Diet for a Small Planet and Getting a Grip: Clarity, Creativity, and Courage in a World Gone Mad.

Books,"Digital Fortress Review Amazon.com Review In most thrillers, """"hardware"""" consists of big guns, airplanes, military vehicles, and weapons that make things explode. Dan Brown has written a thriller for those of us who like our hardware with disc drives and who rate our heroes by big brainpower rather than big firepower. It's an Internet user's spy novel where the good guys and bad guys struggle over secrets somewhat more intellectual than just where the secret formula is hidden--they have to gain understanding of what the secret formula actually is.  In this case, the secret formula is a new means of encryption, capable of changing the balance of international power. Part of the fun is that the book takes the reader along into an understanding of encryption technologies. You'll find yourself better understanding the political battles over such real-life technologies as the Clipper Chip and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software even though the book looks at the issues through the eyes of fiction.  Although there's enough globehopping in this book for James Bond, the real battleground is cyberspace, because that's where the """"bomb"""" (or rather, the new encryption algorithm) will explode. Yes, there are a few flaws in the plot if you look too closely, but the cleverness and the sheer fun of it all more than make up for them. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and a lot of high, gee-whiz-level information about encryption, code breaking, and the role they play in international politics. Set aside the whole afternoon and evening for it and have finger food on hand for supper--you may want to read this one straight through.  About the Author Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestselling novels, including Digital Fortress, Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, which has sold more than 80 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling novels of all time. Named one of the World's 100 Most Influential People by TIME Magazine, he has appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Forbes, People, GQ, The New Yorker and others.

Books,"The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming (New York Review Books Classics) Review ""The One-Straw Revolution is one of the founding documents of the alternative food movement, and indispensable to anyone hoping to understand the future of food and agriculture.""—Michael Pollan""Only the ignorant could write off Fukuoka, who died two years ago at the age of 95, as a deluded or nostalgic dreamer...Fukuoka developed ideas that went against the conventional grain....Long before the American Michael Pollan, he was making the connections between intensive agriculture, unhealthy eating habits and a whole destructive economy based on oil."" --Harry Eyres, The Financial Times""Fukuoka's do-nothing approach to farming is not only revolutionary in terms of growing food, but it is also applicable to other aspects of living, (creativity, child-rearing, activism, career, etc.) His holistic message is needed now more than ever as we search for new ways of approaching the environment, our community and life. It is time for us all to join his 'non-movement.'""—Keri Smith author of How to be an Explorer of the World “Japan’s most celebrated alternative farmer...Fukuoka’s vision offers a beacon, a goal, an ideal to strive for.” —Tom Philpott, Grist “The One-Straw Revolution shows the critical role of locally based agroecological knowledge in developing sustainable farming systems.” —Sustainable Architecture “With no ploughing, weeding, fertilizers, external compost, pruning or chemicals, his minimalist approach reduces labour time to a fifth of more conventional practices. Yet his success in yields is comparable to more resource-intensive methods…The method is now being widely adopted to vegetate arid areas. His books, such as The One-Straw Revolution, have been inspirational to cultivators the world over.” —New InternationalistEvery now and then you read a book which is so inspiring and such a pleasure that you feel impelled to stride down the street shouting “read this!” Well, I’ve just read The One-Straw Revolution and I urge everyone to buy or borrow a copy without delay.— Tom Hodgkinson, The Idler   About the Author Masanobu Fukuoka (1913–2008) was born and raised on the Japanese island of Shikoku. He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for number of years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II, he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production, managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war, he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975, distressed by the effects of Japan’s post-war modernization, Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years, Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties, and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Frances Moore Lappé is author or co-author of sixteen books, including Diet for a Small Planet and Getting a Grip: Clarity, Creativity, and Courage in a World Gone Mad. She has co-founded three organizations, including the Institute for Food and Development Policy and, more recently, the Small Planet Institute, which she leads with her daughter Anna Lappé. In 1987, she received the Right Livelihood Award, also called the “Alternative Nobel.” She has received seventeen honorary doctorates and has been a visiting scholar at MIT."

Books,"Digital Fortress Review Amazon.com Review In most thrillers, """"hardware"""" consists of big guns, airplanes, military vehicles, and weapons that make things explode. Dan Brown has written a thriller for those of us who like our hardware with disc drives and who rate our heroes by big brainpower rather than big firepower. It's an Internet user's spy novel where the good guys and bad guys struggle over secrets somewhat more intellectual than just where the secret formula is hidden--they have to gain understanding of what the secret formula actually is.  In this case, the secret formula is a new means of encryption, capable of changing the balance of international power. Part of the fun is that the book takes the reader along into an understanding of encryption technologies. You'll find yourself better understanding the political battles over such real-life technologies as the Clipper Chip and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software even though the book looks at the issues through the eyes of fiction.  Although there's enough globehopping in this book for James Bond, the real battleground is cyberspace, because that's where the """"bomb"""" (or rather, the new encryption algorithm) will explode. Yes, there are a few flaws in the plot if you look too closely, but the cleverness and the sheer fun of it all more than make up for them. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and a lot of high, gee-whiz-level information about encryption, code breaking, and the role they play in international politics. Set aside the whole afternoon and evening for it and have finger food on hand for supper--you may want to read this one straight through.  About the Author Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestselling novels, including Digital Fortress, Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, which has sold more than 80 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling novels of all time. Named one of the World's 100 Most Influential People by TIME Magazine, he has appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Forbes, People, GQ, The New Yorker and others.

From the Inside Flap One of the world?s most beloved and bestselling writers takes his ultimate journey -- into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail -- well, most of it. In In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world?s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.From the Hardcover edition.               See all Product description"

Allied to this candour is a steeliness of purpose. It is no exaggeration to say that every page of this book is, explicitly or otherwise, a reproach to Donald Trump, and a call-to-arms to those who would defeat the 45th President and all that he stands for (Matt D'Ancona Evening Standard)This is a rich, entertaining and candid memoir. And overall she's a fun person to sit alongside as she tells you the story of her life, warts and all. . . it is as beautifully written as any piece of fiction, with a similar warm languid tone to Ann Patchett's novel Commonwealth (Viv Groskop i, Five Stars)This revealing memoir offers new insights into her upbringing on the south side of Chicago and the highs and lows of life with Barack Obama. . . Becoming is a 400-page expansion of this essential doctrine ['when they go low, we go high'], without compromising a refreshing level of honesty about what politics really did to her. I have read Barack Obama's two books so far, and this is like inserting a missing piece of reality into the narrative of his dizzying journey (Afua Hirsch Guardian)I found myself lifting my jaw from my chest at the end of every other chapter, not because of any seedy insight into stories I'd always wondered about, but because, armed as I was with knowledge about her career, her mannerisms, and even her elbow-heavy dancing, this was not the Obama I thought I knew. She was more (Kuba Shand-Baptiste Independent)Inspiring. . . After 421 pages of Becoming, I closed the book hoping that one day she would use her formidable intelligence, humanity - and humour - to offer a more tangible vision for how America might fight the rising tides of polarisation and hate (Financial Times)Open and engaging. . . Obama writes with candour about the good times and bad. (Daily Express)Of course, Becoming is Michelle Obama's story, of how she moved from a girl on the South Side of Chicago to becoming one of the most powerful women in the world. But in the final pages of the book, Obama writes, ""It's all a process, steps along a path. Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor."" Here, Obama is pushing us to reckon with our own becomings - to realise our own story and to have the power to tell it.

Jack Ma is part Bill Gates, part Steve Jobs, part Larry Page, part Sergei Brin, and part Mark Zuckerberg all rolled into one.” (Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP)“Useful, business-minded reporting on an unconventional corporate magnate, containing both corporate and human-interest perspectives.” (Kirkus Reviews)“This absorbing and well-written portrayal of Ma’s character, and his role in Alibaba’s development will appeal to a wide range of readers.” (Library Journal)“A clean and compelling narrative…[Clark] tells the story with flair.” (Wall Street Journal)“A fascinating new book.” (The Economist)“A must-read for anyone hoping to navigate China’s new economy”. (Financial Times) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover An engrossing, insider’s account of how a teacher built one of the world’s most valuable companies—rivaling Walmart and Amazon—and forever reshaped the global economyIn just a decade and a half, Jack Ma, a man from modest beginnings who started out as an English teacher, founded Alibaba and built it into one of the world’s largest companies, an e-commerce empire on which hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers depend. In 2014, Alibaba’s $25 billion IPO was the largest global IPO in history. A Rockefeller of his time, who is courted by CEOs and presidents around the world, Jack is an icon for China’s booming private sector and the gatekeeper to hundreds of millions of middle-class consumers. Duncan Clark first met Jack in 1999 in the small apartment where Jack founded Alibaba. Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material, including exclusive interviews, Clark draws on his own experience as an early adviser to Alibaba as well as his two decades in China chronicling the Internet’s impact on the country to create an authoritative, compelling narrative account of Alibaba’s rise.How did Jack overcome his humble origins and early failures to achieve massive success with Alibaba? How did he outsmart rival entrepreneurs from both China and Silicon Valley? Can Alibaba maintain its 80 percent market share? As it forges ahead into finance and entertainment, are there limits to Alibaba’s ambitions? How does the Chinese government view its rise? Will Alibaba expand farther overseas, including into the United States?Clark tells Alibaba’s tale in the context of China’s momentous economic and social changes, illuminating an unlikely corporate titan as never before.Advance Praise For Alibaba“Anybody who thinks the Chinese just copy or steal technology from the West should read this book and think again. Jack Ma is part Bill Gates, part Steve Jobs, part Larry Page, part Sergey Brin, and part Mark Zuckerberg, all rolled into one.”—Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP “Duncan Clark gets into the heart and soul of Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, who deftly maneuvered through the discontinuities and barriers in China to create one of the greatest companies in the world. China has thrived under the leadership of Jack Ma. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the present China and the heartbeat of a great entrepreneur.”—Tim Draper, founder of Draper Associates, DFJ, and Draper University“This book provides excellent insight into the world of Jack Ma, perhaps the most famous of the leaders of the new economy in China. Duncan Clark is a real China ‘Old Hand,’ unique in his knowledge of the Jack Ma generation. This book is definitely on the short list for those who wish to understand the Chinese economy today.”—Ken Wilcox, Chairman Emeritus, Silicon Valley Bank              See all Product description"
Books,"The Theory of Everything Review Stephen Hawking's The Theory of Everything is a short book that can act as an introduction to the subjects of cosmology raised by modern science, but the book is only that; I preferred his Brief History of Time to this work because it was longer, more detailed, and covered more ground. If you are looking for a very basic introduction to the current thinking of astrophysicists, this is a good book; if you really want to wrestle with the subject at length, you should buy a Brief History of Time, or one of Paul Davies works, such as About Time. If you are looking for a good lecture series on physics, Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces and its sequel, Six Not So Easy Pieces is really the finest of this genre. That being said, the book does a good job in outlining the basic subject matter, discussing the development of the Big Bang theory, and the implications of both the general theory of relativity and quantum physics on the formation of the universe. Hawking is at his best when discussing singularities -- the points of the universe, such as black holes, where the laws of physics break down. --By D. W. Casey on June 27, 2002This is a collection of seven related lectures by Hawking originally published in 1996 under the title, The Cambridge Lectures: Life Works. He does not cover as much ground here as in did in A Brief History of Time, but what he does cover he does so in a charming and engaging style. There are some few statements here that could be interpreted as less than modest--although not by me--and a mistaken prediction or two, which may be a reason that Hawking is not pleased with this book's publication. He might also object to the title, since neither a ""Theory of Everything"" nor a conclusive answer to the origin and fate of the universe are presented. However, Hawking does address these questions, and his expression is interesting to read and has the agreeable characteristic of being laconic. There are no equations in the book, no mathematics as such, and everything is explained in language that would be intelligible to a high school student. There are the usual droll Hawking jokes about God and His intentions, facetious, epigram-like understatements (I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. p. 66) and witty asides about the convergence of politics on physics, as when he mentions a particle accelerator the size of the Solar System that ""would not be funded under current economic conditions."" --By Dennis Littrell on March 23, 2003this is one of the most interesting book . hawking has explained the whole universe very briefly . the book explains following things deeply *ideas about universe *expanding universe *black holes *origin and fate of universe *the direction of time * the theory of everything the book explains everything from beginning to the end of universe. it shows the interaction between science and natural powers. science lovers it will lead ur knowledge to a next level --By Shiva Thakur on 30 Sep 2012 				    	 					 About the Author Stephen Hawking is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and author of A Brief History of Time which was an international bestseller. His other books for the general reader include A Briefer History of Time, the essay collection Black Holes and Baby Universe and The Universe in a Nutshell. In 1963, Hawking contracted motor neurone disease and was given two years to live. Yet he went on to Cambridge to become a brilliant researcher and Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. Since 1979 he has held the post of Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, the chair held by Isaac Newton in 1663. Professor Hawking has over a dozen honorary degrees and was awarded the CBE in 1982. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Science. Stephen Hawking is regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Einstein."

Casey on June 27, 2002This is a collection of seven related lectures by Hawking originally published in 1996 under the title, The Cambridge Lectures: Life Works. He does not cover as much ground here as in did in A Brief History of Time, but what he does cover he does so in a charming and engaging style. There are some few statements here that could be interpreted as less than modest--although not by me--and a mistaken prediction or two, which may be a reason that Hawking is not pleased with this book's publication. He might also object to the title, since neither a ""Theory of Everything"" nor a conclusive answer to the origin and fate of the universe are presented. However, Hawking does address these questions, and his expression is interesting to read and has the agreeable characteristic of being laconic. There are no equations in the book, no mathematics as such, and everything is explained in language that would be intelligible to a high school student. There are the usual droll Hawking jokes about God and His intentions, facetious, epigram-like understatements (I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. p. 66) and witty asides about the convergence of politics on physics, as when he mentions a particle accelerator the size of the Solar System that ""would not be funded under current economic conditions."" --By Dennis Littrell on March 23, 2003this is one of the most interesting book . hawking has explained the whole universe very briefly . the book explains following things deeply *ideas about universe *expanding universe *black holes *origin and fate of universe *the direction of time * the theory of everything the book explains everything from beginning to the end of universe. it shows the interaction between science and natural powers. science lovers it will lead ur knowledge to a next level --By Shiva Thakur on 30 Sep 2012 				    	 					 About the Author Stephen Hawking is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and author of A Brief History of Time which was an international bestseller. His other books for the general reader include A Briefer History of Time, the essay collection Black Holes and Baby Universe and The Universe in a Nutshell. In 1963, Hawking contracted motor neurone disease and was given two years to live. Yet he went on to Cambridge to become a brilliant researcher and Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. Since 1979 he has held the post of Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, the chair held by Isaac Newton in 1663. Professor Hawking has over a dozen honorary degrees and was awarded the CBE in 1982. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Science. Stephen Hawking is regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Einstein."

These are one of the most enduring lines that still lay etched in my memory. I have read this book long back, and I don't remember when, but surely the essence remains with me even today. This book is best suited for reading for the teenagers, to dream and to dare. It shows, how a person from the modest background ends up in being the First Citizen of a nation of one billion. It shows how a scientist, devoid of basic tools, helps in culmination of a program which other love to loathe and deride. It shows a man, who lived his life in terms of his principles and nothing else. It shows how a common man, like you and me, can achieve when he can dream.

Books,"The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe Amazon.com Review With a title inspired as much by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker series as Einstein, The Theory of Everything delivers almost as much as it promises. Transcribed from Stephen Hawking's Cambridge Lectures, the slim volume may not present a single theory unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces, but it does carefully explain the state of late 20th-century physics with the great scientist's characteristic humility and charm. Explicitly shunning math, Hawking explains the fruits of 100 years of heavy thinking with metaphors that are simple but never condescending--he compares the settling of the newborn universe into symmetry to the formation of ice crystals in a glass of water, for example. While he explores his own work (especially when speaking about black holes), he also discusses the important milestones achieved by others like Richard Feynman. Though occasionally an impenetrably obscure phrase does slip by, the reader will find the bulk of the text enlightening and engaging. The material, from the nature of time to the possibility that the universe has no beginning or end, is rich and deep and inevitably ignites metaphysical thinking. After all, Hawking is famous for his ""we would know the mind of God"" remark, which ends the final lecture herein. --Rob Lightner  From the Publisher Audio version delivered by Stephen W. Hawking using a voice synthesizer machine."

(Financial Times) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover An engrossing, insider’s account of how a teacher built one of the world’s most valuable companies—rivaling Walmart and Amazon—and forever reshaped the global economyIn just a decade and a half, Jack Ma, a man from modest beginnings who started out as an English teacher, founded Alibaba and built it into one of the world’s largest companies, an e-commerce empire on which hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers depend. In 2014, Alibaba’s $25 billion IPO was the largest global IPO in history. A Rockefeller of his time, who is courted by CEOs and presidents around the world, Jack is an icon for China’s booming private sector and the gatekeeper to hundreds of millions of middle-class consumers. Duncan Clark first met Jack in 1999 in the small apartment where Jack founded Alibaba. Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material, including exclusive interviews, Clark draws on his own experience as an early adviser to Alibaba as well as his two decades in China chronicling the Internet’s impact on the country to create an authoritative, compelling narrative account of Alibaba’s rise.How did Jack overcome his humble origins and early failures to achieve massive success with Alibaba? How did he outsmart rival entrepreneurs from both China and Silicon Valley? Can Alibaba maintain its 80 percent market share? As it forges ahead into finance and entertainment, are there limits to Alibaba’s ambitions? How does the Chinese government view its rise? Will Alibaba expand farther overseas, including into the United States?Clark tells Alibaba’s tale in the context of China’s momentous economic and social changes, illuminating an unlikely corporate titan as never before.Advance Praise For Alibaba“Anybody who thinks the Chinese just copy or steal technology from the West should read this book and think again.

Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material including exclusive interviews, Clark draws on his own experience as an early adviser to Alibaba and two decades in China chronicling the Internet’s impact on the country to create an authoritative, compelling narrative account of Alibaba’s rise. Clark tells Alibaba’s tale in the context of China’s momentous economic and social changes, illuminating an unlikely corporate titan as never before.

Books,"Four Chapters on Freedom: Commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: 1 Review I have read more than one translation of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and this, by far, is the best one. Swami Satyananda Saraswati presents a very clear, direct explanation of each sutra in English. There is both a Sanskrit and English version of the Sutras before the English explanation. Each sutra is treated individually with Swami Satyananda Saraswati's insights which illuminate the text so that the most knowledge can be gained from reading about very ancient yet important yoga precepts. I read a lot of ratings which mark a text down for its ""complexity"", and I don't know if that is necessary here. I would say the text is thorough, which is what you want when a yogi translates and interprets the text. You want to get both a context and a further foundation for further study, and this book provides both. This is definitely 5 stars, and if you enjoy it, try looking at other works by the same author. He's one of the most intelligent authors I have come across on the subject of yoga. --D. Casey've read a couple different texts on the commentary of the Yoga Sutras but this is the best yet. The book is comprehensive and easy to read. Each sutra is thoroughly discussed extensively. Swami Satyananda Saraswati's comments helped changed my perspective on my everyday outlook and each time I revisit the text I notice something I didn't recognize the time before. It's like the routine of driving to work and sitting at a red light on the way and one day noticing a tree that seems to appear out of nowhere; however, the tree is mature and permanent. It's clear the tree has been there since ""forever"", though I never saw it of all the times I've traveled down the familiar road. That's the familiar experience I'm talking about whenever I refer back to the text. This book is a treasure of knowledge and is essential for householders on the path. --ChandraFor beginners, this book is not about asana (postures)and there are very few verses about asana. If one looks for asana, then they should read the book Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha. This book is for more serious people who are seeking to practice Raja Yoga and desiring enlightenment and self realization. This book talks about how to get into samadhi (Chapter 1: Samadhi Pada) Samadhi meaning higher level of concentrated meditation or dhyana; how to perform sadhana (chapter 2: sadhana pada)Sadhana is a way of discipline in pursuit of a goal; Chapter 3 is Vibhooti pada, which is advanced and discusses about Samyama (Samyama is achieved with the combination of samadhi, dharana (concentration) and sadhana) and final chapter is Kaivalya Pada. Kaivalya Pada is about siddhi (siddhi meaning performing accomplishment and attainment of moksha). Siddhi can also mean miracles and attainment of eternality on one's own. This book is a commentary not a translation work as written by some reviewers. Yoga Sutra was written by Patanjali more than 25 centuries ago. There were many great people such as Swami Vivekananda, Swami Satchithananda, other than Swami Satyananda Saraswati, had authored books on Yoga Sutras by Patanjali in recent century. How is this book different from other books? Author had implemented Patanjali Yoga Sutras in his life and in his disciples' lives and students lives and had seen the benefits out of them. His real life experience speaks through his commentary work. By reading this book, will one be able to practice advanced topics such as samadhi and samyama and siddhi on their own? My answer is NO. This book work provides an excellent theoretical knowledge and one has to seek a Master Guru, who follows Patanjali Yoga Sutra way of life, can guide and hand hold him/ her. In the western world, yoga is used more of a physical exercise and I have not come across any Western Guru who was able to guide me in Samyama, dharana and dhyana. I also found that there are not many Yoga Gurus, who can teach and guide in advanced topics such as samadhi and samyama. I know very few Gurus teach Samyama, one is Bihar School of Yoga's Trainer Swamijis and another is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev. --Shankar Ganesh 				    	 					 About the Author Swami Satyananda Saraswati, born on the 24th of December, 1923, was a spiritual leader and yoga expert responsible for popularising the concept of yoga outside India. He is the author of over 80 books, including Dynamics Of Yoga: The Foundations Of Bihar Yoga, Tattwa Shuddhi: The Tantric Practice Of Inner Purification, and his best known work, Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha. He established the International Yoga Fellowship in 1956 and the Bihar School Of Yoga in 1963. He died on the 5th of December, 2009, at Rikhiapeeth, Jharkhand."

Books,"A Brief History of Time: And Other Essays Amazon.com Review Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history, wrote the modern classic A Brief History of Time to help nonscientists understand the questions being asked by scientists today: Where did the universe come from? How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end, and if so, how? Hawking attempts to reveal these questions (and where we're looking for answers) using a minimum of technical jargon. Among the topics gracefully covered are gravity, black holes, the Big Bang, the nature of time, and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory. This is deep science; these concepts are so vast (or so tiny) as to cause vertigo while reading, and one can't help but marvel at Hawking's ability to synthesize this difficult subject for people not used to thinking about things like alternate dimensions. The journey is certainly worth taking, for, as Hawking says, the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of ""the mind of God."" --Therese Littleton  Review “[Hawking] can explain the complexities of cosmological physics with an engaging combination of clarity and wit. . . . His is a brain of extraordinary power.”—The New York Review of Books   “Lively and provocative . . . Mr. Hawking clearly possesses a natural teacher’s gifts—easy, good-natured humor and an ability to illustrate highly complex propositions with analogies plucked from daily life.”—The New York Times   “Even as he sits helpless in his wheelchair, his mind seems to soar ever more brilliantly across the vastness of space and time to unlock the secrets of the universe.”—Time   “This book marries a child’s wonder to a genius’s intellect. We journey into Hawking’s universe while marvelling at his mind.”—The Sunday Times (London)   “A masterful summary of what physicists now think the world is made of and how it got that way.”—The Wall Street Journal   “Charming and lucid . . . [A book of] sunny brilliance.”—The New Yorker               See all Product description"

Books,"A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes Review ""This app/book version of Hawking's famous laymen book is just an amazing piece of learning. This makes much more accessible and understandable the complex and awesome topics dealt by Hawking as he explains how our universe works. I am just in awe at how creative he is to produce one of a kind e-book like this. The pace, illustrations and connections of topics within the book are so helpful and so appropriate for the new generation used to tweets and small bites of information. You can flip over some topics when you have some time, learn some amazing fact, and come back later which no rush or worry about how fast you are progressing through the book. Hope other books on complex topics are translated to this format. And I love the updates of the latest science since the publication of the original book.

Books,"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind Review “Sapiens tackles the biggest questions of history and of the modern world, and it is written in unforgettably vivid language.” (Jared Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Guns, Germs, and Steel, Collapse, and The World until Yesterday)“Sapiens is learned, thought-provoking and crisply written…. Fascinating.” (Wall Street Journal)“In Sapiens, Harari delves deep into our history as a species to help us understand who we are and what made us this way. An engrossing read.” (Dan Ariely, New York Times Bestselling author of Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality, and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty)“Yuval Noah Harari’s celebrated Sapiens does for human evolution what Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time did for physics.… He does a superb job of outlining our slow emergence and eventual domination of the planet.” (Forbes)“[I]nteresting and provocative…It gives you a sense of perspective on how briefly we’ve been on this earth, how short things like agriculture and science have been around, and why it makes sense for us to not take them for granted.” (President Barack Obama)“I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a fun, engaging look at early human history…you’ll have a hard time putting it down.” (Bill Gates)“Thank God someone finally wrote [this] exact book.” (Sebastian Junger)“Sapiens takes readers on a sweeping tour of the history of our species…. Harari’s formidable intellect sheds light on the biggest breakthroughs in the human story…important reading for serious-minded, self-reflective sapiens.” (Washington Post)“It is one of the best accounts by a Homo sapiens of the unlikely story of our violent, accomplished species.…It is one hell of a story. And it has seldom been told better…. Compulsively readable and impossibly learned.” (Michael Gerson, Washington Post)“This was the most surprising and thought-provoking book I read this year.” (Atlantic.com) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover One hundred thousand years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Professor Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical—and sometimes devastating—breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics, and incorporating full-color illustrations throughout the text, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behavior from the legacy of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging, and provocative, Sapiens integrates history and science to challenge everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our heritage...and our future.
